/***XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Primary layout rules XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

To change many of the widths/heights requires that other certain values must
also be changed at the same time. For this reason, beside these critical
attributes (or nearby if comment hacks do not allow) are comments with the
calculations as to how to adjust them.

These guidance comments start with /*** and end with ***/

/***
You can delete these if you want, but do not delete MAC Hack comments (see
below).

To change the width of the entire layout, adjust the columns that make up the
total, remembering the borders. Remember, even one small mistake will degrade
or even break the layout, so be very careful!

For spacing within the cols, it's best to apply margins on content elements
inserted into the cols, because padding directly on those col elements will
change their widths, breaking the layout.

Certain hiding hacks have been used extensively in this layout, so here is a
quick explanation of them.

The Safari escape tab hack:
***************************

 (used on wrapper, and the 3 backgrounds for Moz
and Opera).

Puts an escape in front of a valid number in the style name to replace a
letter in that name, e.g. \65 is an e. A tab is then inserted (not a space).
The purpose of this hack is to hide some code from Safari. Unfortunately,
some other browsers (like IE) see it for what it should be (but NOT Safari),
and so we must undo the code for those browsers by other hacks.

The Tan hack:
*************

* html .anyelement {rules read only by IE/Win and IE/Mac}

The MAC hack:
*************

(first the active comment you are reading now must be
closed...) ***/

/* \*/

/* */

/***...Back in comment mode now. Anything between those two comment lines
will be hidden from IE/Mac. Don't use any comments within this hack or it will
close prematurely and IE/Mac will begin reading before it should.

The above two hacks are combined so as to feed rules only to IE/Win.

The Holly Hack:
***************

Proper use of backslash escape characters inside property names used in the
Holly hack can further segregate rules to be read by only IE6 from rules for
IE5.x/Win.

These hiding hacks, along with several other fixes, make possible this formerly
impossible layout. It is highly unlikely that new browsers will have any
problem with these valid hiding hacks, and we will have to wait for Microsoft
to release IE7.

If enabled in the PageMaker, the 100% height in the html and body styles makes
the design full height. It also breaks Moz because you should use min-height,
but that doesn't work! Note
how these 100% heights are hidden from IE Mac with
the MAC Hack, otherwise they break it.

min-height:100% from this point inwards to the center of the design - a nasty bug.
If you change this to height:100% moz won't expand the design if content grows.

/*** a Note on the Holly hack: if IE/Win shows bugs it's a good idea to apply the height:1%
