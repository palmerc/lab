Behind/IN all/DT the/DT hoopla/NN is/VBZ some/DT heavy-duty/JJ competition/NN ./. 
As/IN individual/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP turned/VBN away/RB from/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, securities/NNS firms/NNS have/VBP scrambled/VBN to/TO find/VB new/JJ products/NNS that/WDT brokers/NNS find/VBP easy/JJ to/TO sell/VB ./.

History/NN ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, is/VBZ not/RB on/IN his/PP$ side/NN ./. 
According/VBG to/TO a/DT nationwide/JJ survey/NN taken/VBN a/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, nearly/RB a/DT third/JJ of/IN England/NP 's/POS church/NN bells/NNS are/VBP no/RB longer/RBR rung/VBN on/IN Sundays/NNS because/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT one/CD to/TO ring/VB them/PP ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO see/VB why/WRB the/DT ancient/JJ art/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT ropes/NNS ./. 
The/DT less/RBR complicated/JJ version/NN of/IN playing/VBG tunes/NNS on/IN bells/NNS ,/, as/IN do/VB the/DT carillons/NNS of/IN continental/JJ Europe/NP ,/, is/VBZ considered/VBN by/IN the/DT English/NP to/TO be/VB childish/JJ ,/, fit/JJ only/RB for/IN foreigners/NNS ./. 
Change-ringing/NN ,/, a/DT mind-boggling/JJ exercise/NN the/DT English/NP invented/VBD 380/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, requires/VBZ physical/JJ dexterity/NN --some/DT bells/NNS weigh/VBP more/JJR than/IN a/DT ton/NN --combined/VBN with/IN intense/JJ mental/JJ concentration/NN ./. 
Proper/JJ English/JJ bells/NNS are/VBP started/VBN off/RP in/IN ``/`` rounds/NNS ,/, ''/'' from/IN the/DT highest-pitched/JJ bell/NN to/TO the/DT lowest/JJS --a/DT simple/JJ descending/VBG scale/NN using/VBG ,/, in/IN larger/JJR churches/NNS ,/, as/RB many/JJ as/IN 12/CD bells/NNS ./. 
Then/RB ,/, at/IN a/DT signal/NN ,/, the/DT ringers/NNS begin/VBP varying/VBG the/DT order/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT bells/NNS sound/VBP without/IN altering/VBG the/DT steady/JJ rhythm/NN of/IN the/DT striking/JJ ./. 
Each/DT variation/NN ,/, or/CC change/NN ,/, can/MD occur/VB only/RB once/RB ,/, the/DT rules/NNS state/VBP ./. 
Ringers/NNS memorize/VBP patterns/NNS of/IN changes/NNS ,/, known/VBN as/IN ``/`` methods/NNS ,/, ''/'' which/WDT have/VBP odd-sounding/JJ names/NNS like/IN Kent/NP Treble/NP Bob/NP Major/NP or/CC Grandsire/NP Caters/NP ./. 
A/DT series/NN of/IN 5,000/CD or/CC so/RB changes/NNS is/VBZ a/DT ``/`` peal/NN ''/'' and/CC takes/VBZ about/RB three/CD hours/NNS ./. 
A/DT look/NN at/IN a/DT Thursday/NP night/NN practice/NN at/IN St./NP Mary/NP Abbot/NP church/NN in/IN the/DT Kensington/NP district/NN of/IN London/NP gives/VBZ an/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT work/NN involved/VBN ./. 
Ten/CD shirt-sleeved/JJ ringers/NNS stand/VBP in/IN a/DT circle/NN ,/, one/CD foot/NN ahead/RB of/IN the/DT other/JJ in/IN a/DT prize-fighter/NN 's/POS stance/NN ,/, each/DT pulling/VBG a/DT rope/NN that/WDT disappears/VBZ through/IN a/DT small/JJ hole/NN in/IN the/DT high/JJ ceiling/NN of/IN the/DT ringing/NN chamber/NN ./. 
No/DT one/PP speaks/VBZ ,/, and/CC the/DT snaking/VBG of/IN the/DT ropes/NNS seems/VBZ to/TO make/VB as/IN much/JJ sound/NN as/IN the/DT bells/NNS themselves/PP ,/, muffled/VBN by/IN the/DT ceiling/NN ./. 
Totally/RB absorbed/VBN ,/, the/DT ringers/NNS stare/VBP straight/RB ahead/RB ,/, using/VBG peripheral/JJ vision/NN (/( they/PP call/VBP it/PP ``/`` rope-sight/NN ''/'' )/) to/TO watch/VB the/DT other/JJ ropes/NNS and/CC thus/RB time/VB their/PP$ pulls/NNS ./.

This/DT does/VBZ not/RB sit/VB well/RB with/IN some/DT clerics/NNS ./. 
With/IN membership/NN of/IN the/DT Church/NP of/IN England/NP steadily/RB dwindling/VBG ,/, strong-willed/JJ vicars/NNS are/VBP pressing/VBG equally/RB strong-willed/JJ and/CC often/RB non-religious/JJ ringers/NNS to/TO attend/VB services/NNS ./.

At/IN St./NP Mary/NP 's/POS Church/NP in/IN Ilminster/NP ,/, Somerset/NP ,/, the/DT bells/NNS have/VBP fallen/VBN silent/JJ following/VBG a/DT dust-up/NN over/IN church/NN attendance/NN ./.

This/DT interpretation/NN was/VBD officially/RB endorsed/VBN by/IN Congress/NP in/IN 1987/CD in/IN the/DT Iran-Contra/NP Report/NP ./. 
As/IN partisans/NNS of/IN congressional/JJ power/NN understand/VBP ,/, a/DT ``/`` power/NN of/IN the/DT purse/NN ''/'' so/RB broadly/RB construed/VBN would/MD emasculate/VB the/DT presidency/NN and/CC swallow/VB the/DT principle/NN of/IN separation/NN of/IN powers/NNS ./. 
It/PP is/VBZ not/RB supported/VBN by/IN the/DT text/NN or/CC history/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NP ./. 
The/DT framers/NNS hardly/RB discussed/VBD the/DT appropriations/NNS clause/NN at/IN the/DT Constitutional/NP Convention/NP of/IN 1787/CD ,/, according/VBG to/TO Madison/NP 's/POS notes/NNS ./. 
To/TO the/DT extent/NN they/PP did/VBD ,/, their/PP$ concern/NN was/VBD to/TO ensure/VB fiscal/JJ accountability/NN ./.

It/PP would/MD contradict/VB that/DT objective/NN if/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS clause/NN (/( technically/RB a/DT limitation/NN on/IN legislative/JJ power/NN )/) could/MD be/VB read/VBN as/IN placing/VBG the/DT president/NN on/IN Congress/NP 's/POS short/JJ leash/NN ,/, making/VBG the/DT executive/NN consist/VBP of/IN the/DT president/NN and/CC every/DT member/NN of/IN Congress/NP ./. 
As/IN it/PP went/VBD to/TO the/DT conference/NN panel/NN now/RB deliberating/VBG ,/, the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN for/IN fiscal/JJ 1990/CD contained/VBD some/DT breathtaking/JJ attempts/NNS by/IN Congress/NP to/TO rewrite/VB the/DT Constitution/NP under/IN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN protecting/VBG the/DT public/NN 's/POS money/NN ./. 
During/IN the/DT coming/VBG weeks/NNS ,/, President/NP Bush/NP must/MD decide/VB whether/IN to/TO veto/VB the/DT bills/NNS containing/VBG them/PP --/: or/CC ,/, alternatively/RB ,/, to/TO sign/VB these/DT bills/NNS into/IN law/NN with/IN a/DT statement/NN declaring/VBG their/PP$ intrusions/NNS on/IN executive/JJ power/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN violation/NN of/IN Article/NP II/NP ,/, and/CC thus/RB void/JJ and/CC severable/JJ ./. 
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS legislation/NN attempts/VBZ to/TO strip/VB the/DT president/NN of/IN his/PP$ powers/NNS to/TO make/VB certain/JJ appointments/NNS as/IN provided/VBN by/IN Article/NP II/NP ./. 
Article/NP II/NP places/VBZ on/IN the/DT president/NN the/DT duty/NN to/TO nominate/VB ,/, ``/`` and/CC by/IN and/CC with/IN the/DT Advice/NP and/CC Consent/NP of/IN the/DT Senate/NP ''/'' appoint/VB ,/, ambassadors/NNS ,/, judges/NNS ,/, and/CC other/JJ officers/NNS of/IN the/DT U.S/NP ./. 
It/PP also/RB empowers/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recess/NN appointments/NNS ,/, without/IN Senate/NP approval/NN :/: ``/`` The/DT President/NP shall/MD have/VB Power/NN to/TO fill/VB up/IN all/DT Vacancies/NNS that/WDT may/MD happen/VB during/IN the/DT Recess/NN of/IN the/DT Senate/NP ,/, by/IN granting/VBG Commissions/NNS which/WDT shall/MD expire/VB at/IN the/DT End/NN of/IN their/PP$ next/JJ Session/NN ./. 
''/'' Yet/RB Section/NP 605/CD of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN provides/VBZ :/: ``/`` No/DT part/NN of/IN any/DT appropriation/NN for/IN the/DT current/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN contained/VBN in/IN this/DT or/CC any/DT other/JJ Act/NN shall/MD be/VB paid/VBN to/TO any/DT person/NN for/IN the/DT filling/NN of/IN any/DT position/NN for/IN which/WDT he/PP or/CC she/PP has/VBZ been/VBN nominated/VBN after/IN the/DT Senate/NP has/VBZ voted/VBN not/RB to/TO approve/VB the/DT nomination/NN of/IN said/VBN person/NN ./. 
''/'' Thus/RB ,/, with/IN one/CD brief/JJ passage/NN in/IN an/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN ,/, Congress/NP repeals/VBZ the/DT president/NN 's/POS power/NN to/TO make/VB recess/NN appointments/NNS under/IN Article/NP II/NP ./.

The/DT language/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS rider/NN implies/VBZ that/IN any/DT nomination/NN to/TO any/DT position/NN of/IN a/DT rejected/VBN nominee/NN will/MD result/VB in/IN the/DT president/NN being/VBG denied/VBN funding/VBG to/TO pay/VB that/DT person/NN 's/POS salary/NN ./. 
The/DT president/NN could/MD probably/RB not/RB avoid/VB this/DT restriction/NN by/IN choosing/VBG people/NNS willing/JJ to/TO serve/VB without/IN pay/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT Anti-Deficiency/NP Act/NP prohibits/VBZ voluntary/JJ service/NN to/TO the/DT government/NN ./. 
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS bills/NNS also/RB contain/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/`` muzzling/JJ ''/'' provisions/NNS that/WDT violate/VBP the/DT recommendation/NN clause/NN in/IN Article/NP II/NP of/IN the/DT Constitution/NP ./.

Such/JJ laws/NNS violate/VBP the/DT provision/NN in/IN Article/NP II/NP that/WDT requires/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recommendations/NNS to/TO Congress/NP ,/, but/CC which/WDT gives/VBZ the/DT president/NN the/DT discretion/NN to/TO select/VB the/DT subject/JJ matter/NN of/IN those/DT recommendations/NNS ./.

Probably/RB the/DT most/RBS egregious/JJ example/NN is/VBZ a/DT proviso/NN in/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/NN that/WDT prevents/VBZ the/DT president/NN 's/POS Office/NP of/IN Management/NP and/CC Budget/NP from/IN subjecting/VBG agricultural/JJ marketing/NN orders/NNS to/TO any/DT cost-benefit/JJ scrutiny/NN ./. 
There/EX is/VBZ something/NN inherently/RB suspect/JJ about/IN Congress/NP 's/POS prohibiting/VBG the/DT executive/NN from/IN even/RB studying/VBG whether/IN public/JJ funds/NNS are/VBP being/VBG wasted/VBN in/IN some/DT favored/VBN program/NN or/CC other/JJ ./. 
Perhaps/RB none/NN of/IN the/DT unconstitutional/JJ conditions/NNS contained/VBN in/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bills/NNS for/IN fiscal/JJ 1990/CD better/RBR illustrates/VBZ Congress/NP 's/POS attempt/NN to/TO usurp/VB executive/JJ power/NN than/IN Section/NN 609/CD of/IN the/DT executive-office/NN bill/NN :/: ``/`` None/NN of/IN the/DT funds/NNS made/VBN available/JJ pursuant/JJ to/TO the/DT provisions/NNS of/IN this/DT Act/NN shall/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO implement/VB ,/, administer/VB ,/, or/CC enforce/VB any/DT regulation/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN disapproved/VBN pursuant/JJ to/TO a/DT resolution/NN of/IN disapproval/NN duly/RB adopted/VBN in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT applicable/JJ law/NN of/IN the/DT United/NP States/NPS ./.

The/DT Supreme/NP Court/NP 's/POS decision/NN in/IN INS/NP v./CC Chadha/NP held/VBD that/IN legislative/JJ vetoes/NNS are/VBP unconstitutional/JJ ./.

That/DT represents/VBZ a/DT very/RB thin/JJ ``/`` excess/JJ ''/'' return/NN ,/, certainly/RB far/RB less/JJR than/IN what/WP most/RBS fundamental/JJ stock/NN pickers/NNS claim/VBP to/TO seek/VB as/IN their/PP$ performance/NN objective/NN ./. 
The/DT fact/NN that/IN a/DT vast/JJ majority/NN of/IN fundamentalist/JJ money/NN managers/NNS fail/VBP to/TO beat/VB the/DT S&P/NP 500/CD may/MD contribute/VB to/TO the/DT hysteria/NN surrounding/VBG the/DT issue/NN ./.

So/RB if/IN index/NN arbitrage/NN is/VBZ simply/RB taking/VBG advantage/NN of/IN thin/JJ inefficiencies/NNS between/IN two/CD markets/NNS for/IN the/DT same/JJ widget/NN ,/, how/WRB did/VBD ``/`` program/NN trading/NN ''/'' evolve/VB into/IN the/DT evil/JJ creature/NN that/WDT is/VBZ evoking/VBG the/DT curses/NNS of/IN so/RB many/JJ observers/NNS ?/.

A/DT large/JJ investor/NN will/MD likely/RB cause/VB the/DT futures/NNS market/NN to/TO decline/VB when/WRB he/PP sells/VBZ his/PP$ futures/NNS ./. 
Arbitrage/NN simply/RB transfers/VBZ his/PP$ selling/NN pressure/NN from/IN Chicago/NP to/TO New/NP York/NP ,/, while/IN functioning/VBG as/IN a/DT buyer/NN in/IN Chicago/NP ./. 
The/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ process/NN is/VBZ the/DT key-someone/NN must/MD fundamentally/RB increase/VB or/CC decrease/VB his/PP$ ownership/NN in/IN widgets/NNS to/TO make/VB widget/NN prices/NNS move/VB ./. 
Why/WRB does/VBZ this/DT large/JJ hypothetical/JJ seller/NN trade/VB in/IN Chicago/NP instead/RB of/IN New/NP York/NP ?/.

If/IN not/RB Chicago/NP ,/, then/RB in/IN New/NP York/NP ;/: if/IN not/RB the/DT U.S./NP ,/, then/RB overseas/RB ./. 
Volatility/NN surrounding/VBG his/PP$ trades/NNS occurs/VBZ not/RB because/IN of/IN index/NN arbitrage/NN ,/, but/CC because/IN his/PP$ is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ addition/NN or/CC subtraction/NN to/TO a/DT widget/NN market/NN with/IN finite/JJ liquidity/NN ./. 
Eliminate/VB arbitrage/NN and/CC liquidity/NN will/MD decline/VB instead/RB of/IN rising/VBG ,/, creating/VBG more/JJR volatility/NN instead/RB of/IN less/JJR ./. 
The/DT speed/NN of/IN his/PP$ transaction/NN is/VBZ n't/RB to/TO be/VB feared/VBN either/RB ,/, because/IN faster/JJR and/CC cleaner/JJR execution/NN is/VBZ desirable/JJ ,/, not/RB loathsome/JJ ./.

''/'' Policies/NNS designed/VBN to/TO encourage/VB one/CD type/NN of/IN investor/NN over/IN another/DT are/VBP akin/JJ to/TO placing/VBG a/DT sign/NN over/IN the/DT Big/NP Board/NP 's/POS door/NN saying/VBG :/: ``/`` Buyers/NNS welcome/VB ,/, sellers/NNS please/VB go/VB away/RB /) ''/'' The/DT ultimate/JJ goal/NN of/IN any/DT investor/NN is/VBZ a/DT profit/NN motive/NN ,/, and/CC regulators/NNS should/MD not/RB concern/VB themselves/PP with/IN whether/IN investors/NNS are/VBP sufficiently/RB focused/VBN on/IN the/DT long/JJ term/NN ./. 
A/DT free/JJ market/NN with/IN a/DT profit/NN motive/NN will/MD attract/VB each/DT investor/NN to/TO the/DT liquidity/NN and/CC risks/NNS he/PP can/MD tolerate/VB ./. 
In/IN point/NN of/IN fact/NN ,/, volatility/NN as/IN measured/VBN by/IN the/DT annualized/JJ standard/JJ deviation/NN of/IN daily/JJ stock/NN price/NN movements/NNS has/VBZ frequently/RB been/VBN much/RB higher/JJR than/IN it/PP is/VBZ today/NN ./.

The/DT loudest/JJS of/IN these/DT reformers/NNS are/VBP money/NN managers/NNS who/WP cater/VBP to/TO smaller/JJR investors/NNS ./.

Jan/NP Leemans/NP ,/, research/NN director/NN ,/, said/VBD this/DT gene/NN was/VBD successfully/RB introduced/VBN in/IN oil-producing/JJ rapeseed/NN plants/NNS ,/, a/DT major/JJ crop/NN in/IN Europe/NP and/CC Canada/NP ,/, using/VBG as/IN a/DT carrier/NN a/DT ``/`` promoter/NN gene/NN ''/'' developed/VBN by/IN Robert/NP Goldberg/NP at/IN the/DT University/NP of/IN California/NP in/IN Los/NP Angeles/NP ./. 
The/DT sterilizing/VBG gene/NN is/VBZ expressed/VBN just/RB before/IN the/DT pollen/NN is/VBZ about/IN to/TO develop/VB and/CC it/PP deactivates/VBZ the/DT anthers/NNS of/IN every/DT flower/NN in/IN the/DT plant/NN ./. 
Mr./NP Leemans/NP said/VBD this/DT genetic/JJ manipulation/NN does/VBZ n't/RB hurt/VB the/DT growth/NN of/IN that/DT plant/NN ./. 
The/DT researchers/NNS also/RB pulled/VBD off/RP a/DT second/JJ genetic/JJ engineering/NN trick/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB male-sterile/JJ plants/NNS in/IN large/JJ enough/JJ numbers/NNS to/TO produce/VB a/DT commercial/JJ hybrid/JJ seed/NN crop/NN ./. 
They/PP attached/VBD a/DT second/JJ gene/NN ,/, for/IN herbicide/NN resistance/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT pollen-inhibiting/JJ gene/NN ./.

Mr./NP Leemans/NP said/VBD the/DT hybrid/NN rapeseeds/NNS created/VBN with/IN this/DT genetic/JJ engineering/NN yield/NN 15/CD %/NN to/TO 30/CD %/NN more/JJR output/NN than/IN the/DT commercial/JJ strains/NNS used/VBN currently/RB ./.

''/'' Ultimately/RB ,/, he/PP says/VBZ ,/, strong/JJ demand/NN could/MD help/VB to/TO drive/VB down/RP interest/NN rates/NNS on/IN mortgage/NN securities/NNS ./. 
At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, Nomura/NP is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ Japanese/JJ institution/NN authorized/VBN to/TO act/VB as/IN a/DT primary/JJ seller/NN of/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP instruments/NNS ./.

These/DT securities/NNS are/VBP attractive/JJ to/TO Japanese/JJ investors/NNS for/IN three/CD reasons/NNS ./. 
First/LS ,/, they/PP are/VBP safe/JJ ./. 
While/IN they/PP are/VBP n't/RB backed/VBN by/IN the/DT full/JJ faith/NN and/CC credit/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NP government/NN ,/, as/IN Treasury/NP bonds/NNS are/VBP ,/, it/PP is/VBZ widely/RB assumed/VBN that/IN the/DT government/NN would/MD support/VB them/PP if/IN necessary/JJ ./. 
(/( U.S./NP Treasury/NP bonds/NNS are/VBP still/RB the/DT dollar-denominated/JJ investment/NN of/IN choice/NN for/IN long-term/JJ Japanese/JJ investors/NNS )/) ./. 
Second/LS ,/, they/PP are/VBP liquid/JJ ./. 
The/DT secondary/JJ market/NN in/IN federally/RB backed/JJ mortgage/NN securities/NNS now/RB exceeds/VBZ $/$ 900/CD billion/CD ,/, or/CC nearly/RB half/NN of/IN the/DT $/$ 2.2/CD trillion/CD in/IN U.S./NP residential/JJ mortgages/NNS issued/VBN ./. 
Third/LS ,/, they/PP offer/VBP high/JJ yields/NNS ./. 
At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, some/DT offer/VBP as/RB much/JJ as/IN 1.6/CD to/TO 1.8/CD percentage/NN points/NNS over/IN Treasury/NP securities/NNS of/IN similar/JJ maturities/NNS ./. 
But/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT risk/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Japanese/NPS discovered/VBD when/WRB they/PP first/RB dipped/VBD their/PP$ toes/NNS into/IN the/DT market/NN nearly/RB five/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./. 
Since/IN most/JJS mortgages/NNS can/MD be/VB prepaid/VBN or/CC refinanced/VBN at/IN any/DT time/NN ,/, issuers/NNS of/IN mortgage/NN securities/NNS retain/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB back/RB their/PP$ bonds/NNS before/IN maturity/NN ./. 
That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT headache/NN for/IN long-term/JJ investors/NNS ,/, since/IN it/PP forces/VBZ them/PP to/TO reinvest/VB their/PP$ money/NN --/: usually/RB at/IN lower/JJR rates/NNS than/IN the/DT original/JJ mortgage/NN securities/NNS carried/VBD ./. 
``/`` Two/CD or/CC three/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, the/DT problem/NN was/VBD that/IN people/NNS did/VBD n't/RB understand/VB the/DT prepayment/NN risk/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Nomura/NN 's/POS Mr./NP Kato/NP ./. 
``/`` So/RB they/PP were/VBD surprised/JJ and/CC very/RB disappointed/JJ by/IN prepayment/NN ./. 
''/'' Compounding/VBG the/DT trouble/NN to/TO Japanese/JJ investors/NNS ,/, mortgage/NN securities/NNS pay/VBP interest/NN monthly/RB ,/, since/IN most/JJS mortgages/NNS require/VBP homeowners/NNS to/TO make/VB monthly/JJ payments/NNS ./. 
But/CC Japanese/JJ institutional/JJ investors/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO quarterly/JJ or/CC semiannual/JJ payments/NNS on/IN their/PP$ investments/NNS ,/, so/IN the/DT monthly/JJ cash/NN flow/NN posed/VBD administrative/JJ problems/NNS ./. 
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, Japanese/JJ investors/NNS steered/VBD clear/RB of/IN the/DT mortgage/NN securities/NNS ./. 
But/CC they/PP did/VBD n't/RB lose/VB touch/NN with/IN the/DT U.S./NP issuers/NNS ./. 
Since/IN 1985/CD ,/, Japanese/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP bought/VBN nearly/RB 80/CD %/NN of/IN $/$ 10/CD billion/CD in/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP corporate/JJ debt/NN issued/VBN to/TO foreigners/NNS ,/, money/NN that/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP uses/VBZ to/TO buy/VB mortgages/NNS from/IN U.S./NP banks/NNS ./. 
And/CC Japanese/JJ investors/NNS took/VBD up/RB nearly/RB all/DT of/IN two/CD $/$ 200/CD million/CD Real/JJ Estate/NP Mortgage/NP Investment/NP Conduits/NNS ,/, a/DT kind/NN of/IN collateralized/JJ mortgage/NN obligation/NN ,/, that/WDT were/VBD offered/VBN to/TO foreigners/NNS this/DT year/NN ./. 
In/IN addition/NN ,/, further/JJ packaging/NN of/IN mortgage-backed/JJ securities/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN Blackstone/VBP 's/POS fund/NN ,/, have/VB reduced/VBN the/DT effects/NNS of/IN prepayment/NN risk/NN and/CC automatically/RB reinvest/VB monthly/JJ payments/NNS so/IN institutions/NNS do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO ./. 
Freddie/NP Mac/NP for/IN years/NNS has/VBZ offered/VBN a/DT so-called/JJ participation/NN certificate/NN that/WDT guarantees/VBZ it/PP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB prepaid/VBN for/IN a/DT set/NN number/NN of/IN years/NNS and/CC offers/VBZ semiannual/JJ payments/NNS ./. 
As/IN Georgia-Pacific/NP 's/POS bid/NN for/IN Great/NP Northern/NP Nekoosa/NP has/VBZ shown/VBN ,/, uninvited/JJ takeovers/NNS are/VBP still/RB alive/JJ despite/IN premature/JJ reports/NNS of/IN their/PP$ demise/NN ./. 
Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT debate/NN about/IN poison/NN pills/NNS will/MD continue/VB to/TO rage/VB in/IN the/DT boardrooms/NNS of/IN corporations/NNS and/CC the/DT halls/NNS of/IN academia/NN ./. 
Although/IN poison/NN pills/NNS come/VBP in/IN different/JJ colors/NNS and/CC shapes/NNS ,/, they/PP usually/RB give/VBP current/JJ shareholders/NNS the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB more/JJR stock/NN of/IN their/PP$ corporation/NN at/IN a/DT large/JJ discount/NN if/IN certain/JJ events/NNS occur/VBP --/: typically/RB ,/, if/IN a/DT hostile/JJ bidder/NN acquires/VBZ more/JJR than/IN a/DT specified/JJ percentage/NN of/IN the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS stock/NN ./. 
However/RB ,/, these/DT discount/NN purchase/NN rights/NNS may/MD generally/RB be/VB redeemed/VBN at/IN a/DT nominal/JJ cost/NN by/IN the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS directors/NNS if/IN they/PP approve/VBP of/IN a/DT bidder/NN ./. 
Supporters/NNS of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS argue/VBP that/DT their/PP$ adoption/NN forces/VBZ bidders/NNS to/TO negotiate/VB with/IN a/DT corporation/NN 's/POS directors/NNS ,/, who/WP are/VBP thereby/RB put/VBN in/IN a/DT better/JJR position/NN to/TO pursue/VB the/DT long-term/JJ interests/NNS of/IN the/DT corporation/NN ./. 
Recent/JJ studies/NNS by/IN Georgeson/NP &/CC Co./NP conclude/VBP that/IN corporations/NNS with/IN poison/NN pills/NNS have/VBP experienced/VBN greater/JJR stock-price/JJ appreciation/NN than/IN corporations/NNS without/IN poison/NN pills/NNS during/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./. 
Critics/NNS of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS argue/VBP that/IN they/PP harm/VBP shareholders/NNS by/IN letting/VBG corporate/JJ management/NN defeat/VB takeover/NN bids/NNS at/IN premium/JJ prices/NNS and/CC by/IN deterring/VBG premium/JJ bids/NNS from/IN ever/RB being/VBG made/VBN to/TO shareholders/NNS ./. 
These/DT critics/NNS are/VBP backed/VBN by/IN several/JJ academic/JJ studies/NNS showing/VBG that/IN the/DT adoption/NN of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS reduces/VBZ shareholder/NN values/NNS not/RB merely/RB in/IN the/DT short/JJ run/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB over/IN longer/JJR periods/NNS ./. 
Institutional/JJ investors/NNS that/WDT must/MD evaluate/VB poison/NN pills/NNS on/IN a/DT regular/JJ basis/NN are/VBP interested/JJ less/RBR in/IN this/DT general/JJ debate/NN than/IN in/IN the/DT answers/NNS to/TO specific/JJ questions/NNS about/IN the/DT corporation/NN issuing/VBG the/DT pill/NN ./. 
Does/VBZ this/DT corporation/NN have/VB a/DT high-quality/JJ management/NN team/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ track/NN record/NN ?/. 
Does/VBZ this/DT team/NN have/VB a/DT viable/JJ strategy/NN for/IN improving/VBG shareholder/NN values/NNS ,/, and/CC does/VBZ this/DT strategy/NN require/VB implementation/NN over/IN an/DT extended/JJ period/NN ?/. 
Will/MD the/DT adoption/NN of/IN this/DT particular/JJ form/NN of/IN a/DT poison/NN pill/NN significantly/RB improve/VB the/DT chances/NNS for/IN management/NN to/TO carry/VB out/RP this/DT strategy/NN ?/. 
If/IN the/DT answers/NNS to/TO these/DT questions/NNS are/VBP affirmative/JJ ,/, then/RB institutional/JJ investors/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO be/VB favorably/RB disposed/JJ toward/IN a/DT specific/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./. 
However/RB ,/, the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/DT once/RB most/JJS poison/JJ pills/NNS are/VBP adopted/VBN ,/, they/PP survive/VBP forever/RB ./. 
Although/IN the/DT current/JJ management/NN team/NN may/MD be/VB outstanding/JJ ,/, who/WP will/MD be/VB the/DT CEO/NP in/IN 10/CD years/NNS ?/. 
Although/IN the/DT five-year/JJ strategy/NN may/MD be/VB excellent/JJ ,/, what/WP will/MD be/VB the/DT strategy/NN in/IN 25/CD years/NNS ?/. 
The/DT solution/NN to/TO this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./. 
The/DT limit/NN could/MD range/VB from/IN three/CD years/NNS to/TO seven/CD years/NNS ,/, depending/VBG on/IN the/DT composition/NN of/IN the/DT management/NN team/NN and/CC the/DT nature/NN of/IN its/PP$ strategic/JJ plan/NN ./. 
At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT period/NN ,/, the/DT poison/NN pill/NN would/MD be/VB eliminated/VBN automatically/RB ,/, unless/IN a/DT new/JJ poison/NN pill/NN were/VBD approved/VBN by/IN the/DT then-current/JJ shareholders/NNS ,/, who/WP would/MD have/VB an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO evaluate/VB the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS strategy/NN and/CC management/NN team/NN at/IN that/DT time/NN ./. 
One/CD rare/JJ example/NN of/IN a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN is/VBZ the/DT shareholder/NN rights/NNS plan/NN adopted/VBN by/IN Pennzoil/NP last/JJ year/NN after/IN it/PP received/VBD a/DT huge/JJ litigation/NN settlement/NN from/IN Texaco/NP ./. 
Pennzoil/NP 's/POS poison/NN pill/NN covers/VBZ five/CD years/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO give/VB current/JJ management/NN enough/JJ time/NN to/TO put/VB these/DT proceeds/NNS to/TO work/VB in/IN a/DT prudent/JJ manner/NN ./. 
Another/DT interesting/JJ example/NN is/VBZ the/DT poison/NN pill/NN adopted/VBN recently/RB by/IN Pittsburgh-based/JJ National/NP Intergroup/NP Inc./NP ,/, a/DT diversified/JJ holding/VBG company/NN ./. 
The/DT State/NP of/IN Wisconsin/NP Investment/NP Board/NP ,/, which/WDT owned/VBD about/IN 7/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS voting/NN stock/NN ,/, worked/VBD with/IN management/NN to/TO devise/VB a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./. 
This/DT pill/NN automatically/RB expires/VBZ after/IN three/CD years/NNS unless/IN continued/VBN by/IN a/DT vote/NN of/IN the/DT shareholders/NNS ./. 
The/DT attitude/NN of/IN the/DT Wisconsin/NP Investment/NP Board/NP reflects/VBZ a/DT growing/VBG receptivity/NN to/TO time-limited/JJ poison/NN pills/NNS on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN institutional/JJ investors/NNS ,/, as/IN shown/VBN by/IN the/DT discussions/NNS at/IN recent/JJ meetings/NNS of/IN the/DT Council/NP of/IN Institutional/NP Investors/NPS and/CC my/PP$ informal/JJ survey/NN of/IN several/JJ retirement/NN plans/NNS with/IN large/JJ stock/NN positions/NNS ./. 
More/RBR widespread/JJ time/NN limits/NNS on/IN poison/NN pills/NNS would/MD allow/VB shareholders/NNS to/TO evaluate/VB a/DT specific/JJ poison/NN pill/NN within/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN a/DT specific/JJ management/NN team/NN 's/POS strategy/NN ./. 
Such/JJ concrete/JJ analysis/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO lead/VB to/TO more/RBR fruitful/JJ dialogue/NN between/IN management/NN and/CC shareholders/NNS than/IN the/DT abstract/JJ debate/NN about/IN poison/NN pills/NNS ./.

Why/WRB ?/. 
So/RB far/RB ,/, Nissan/NP 's/POS new-model/NN successes/NNS are/VBP mostly/RB specialized/JJ vehicles/NNS with/IN limited/JJ sales/NNS potential/NN ./. 
In/IN compact/NN and/CC subcompact/NN cars/NNS ,/, the/DT bread-and-butter/JJ sales/NNS generators/NNS for/IN Japanese/JJ auto/NN makers/NNS ,/, Nissan/NP still/RB trails/VBZ Toyota/NP and/CC Honda/NP ./. 
Nissan/NP hopes/VBZ that/IN that/DT will/MD start/VB to/TO change/VB this/DT fall/NN ,/, with/IN its/PP$ new/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT Stanza/NP compact/JJ sedan/NN ./. 
The/DT Stanza/NP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT nonentity/NN compared/VBN with/IN Honda/NP 's/POS hugely/RB successful/JJ Accord/NP and/CC Toyota/NP 's/POS Camry/NP ./. 
But/CC this/DT year/NN ,/, Honda/NP has/VBZ revamped/VBN the/DT Accord/NP and/CC made/VBD it/PP a/DT midsized/JJ car/NN ./. 
Nissan/NP instead/RB has/VBZ kept/VBN its/PP$ new/JJ Stanza/NP a/DT bit/RB smaller/JJR than/IN that/DT and/CC cut/VBN the/DT base/JJ price/NN 6/CD %/NN ;/: at/IN $/$ 11,450/CD ,/, Stanza/NP prices/NNS start/VBP $/$ 749/CD below/IN the/DT predecessor/NN model/NN yet/RB have/VBP a/DT more-powerful/JJR engine/NN ./.

Nissan/NP 's/POS risk/NN is/VBZ that/IN its/PP$ low-base-price/JJ strategy/NN might/MD get/VB lost/VBN amid/IN the/DT highly/RB publicized/JJ rebates/NNS being/VBG offered/VBN by/IN Detroit/NP 's/POS Big/JJ Three/CD ./.

At/IN the/DT opposite/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, Nissan/NP launches/VBZ its/PP$ luxury/NN Infiniti/NP division/NN on/IN Nov./NP 8/CD --/: three/CD years/NNS after/IN Honda/NN pioneered/VBD Japanese/JJ luxury/NN cars/NNS and/CC two/CD months/NNS after/IN Toyota/NP 's/POS Lexus/NP went/VBD on/IN sale/NN ./. 
Nissan/NP started/VBD advertising/VBG Infiniti/NP fully/RB eight/CD months/NNS before/IN the/DT cars/NNS hit/VBD American/JJ showrooms/NNS ./. 
The/DT ads/NNS featured/VBD fences/NNS ,/, rocks/NNS and/CC pussy-willow/NN buds/NNS --/: almost/RB anything/NN but/CC the/DT cars/NNS themselves/PP ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, Nissan/NP 's/POS sales/NNS goals/NNS for/IN Infiniti/NP are/VBP modest/JJ compared/VBN with/IN Toyota/NP 's/POS targets/NNS for/IN Lexus/NP ./.
