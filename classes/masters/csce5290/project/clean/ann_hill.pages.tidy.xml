<font size=4>

Robert E. Lee's mother, <span class="name" tag_id="0.82873500 1108115577">Ann Hill Carter Lee</span>, was the great-granddaughter of Robert Carter (1663-1732), one of 
America's earliest men of wealth.  Carter's wealth came from service as land agent for the 
English Proprieter, Lord 
Fairfax.  As such, he collected rents on the millions of acres owned by Fairfax in Virginia.  
His position gained for him an estate of some three hundred thousand acres and made him so 
powerful that he became known as "King" Carter.  His wealth, filtered through several generations, was 
the ultimate source of <span class="name" tag_id="0.86676300 1108115602">Ann</span>'s inheritance.

<p><span class="name" tag_id="0.86684000 1108115602">Ann</span>'s father was Charles Carter, one of Virginia's wealthiest planters.  His home 
called <a href="http://www.jamesriverplantations.org">Shirley Plantation</a> was located on the south side of the James River near Richmond, VA.  <span class="name" tag_id="0.86699000 1108115602">Ann</span> 
came from a distinguished family.  It is probable that she was known personally to all seven 
Virginian signers of the Declaration of Independence, to all of whom, save one, she was related 
by ties of consanguinity or marriage. <p>

Comparatively little is known of <span class="name" tag_id="0.86716900 1108115602">Ann</span> personally.  It is believed that the likeness 
shown above is hers because the brooch in the picture, bearing a likeness of 
George Washington, is similar to one known to have been hers.  <span class="name" tag_id="0.86730600 1108115602">Ann</span> was 
born in 1773, though exactly  where is not certain.  <span class="name" tag_id="0.86739400 1108115602">Ann</span> was <span class="definition" tag_id="0.52563600 1108116045">the daughter of Anne Butler Moore</span>, 
Charles Carter's second wife.  She was the tenth of twenty-three children born to Charles' two 
wives.  So, though of a wealthy family, she could not see herself as particularly unique.   
Charles, nonetheless, displayed a lively interest in the welfare of each of his children.  
It may be safely inferred that she posessed a strong sense of family.  Similarly, she was a 
religious person with a strong belief in the existence of a just and benevolent God.      

<p><span class="name" tag_id="0.86772000 1108115602">Ann</span> was not physically strong.  She is said to have suffered from narcolepsy, a disease which
 made her, along with many persons of her time, even those not so afflicted, fearful of being 
buried alive. There is even a legend that she was, indeed, thought dead and nearly so buried.  
As early as 1806 she writes that she was becoming an invalid.  During her stay at the Oronoco 
street home, she needed help negotiating the stairs.  <span class="name" tag_id="0.86794900 1108115602">Ann</span> apparently suffered from tuberculosis 
for an indeterminant time preceding her death.

<p>After the death of his first  wife, the "Divine" Matilda Lee, mistress of Stratford Hall, 
thirty-seven year old,  Virginia Governor and Revolutionary War hero, Henry "Light-Horse Harry" 
Lee came to Shirley to woo Maria Farley one of <span class="name" tag_id="0.86815300 1108115602">Ann</span>'s friends living there.    Upon his being 
rejected by Maria, twenty year old <span class="name" tag_id="0.86825100 1108115602">Ann</span> set about capturing him for herself,  although he was 
seventeen years her senior.  Charles Carter was aware of Lee's reckless reputation and constant 
financial difficulties.  He, therefore, opposed the match, citing Lee's then consideration of 
an offer of a generalship in France's Revolutionary armies.  When Lee rejected the offered 
French commission, Carter lost the reason he had used for stopping the marriage. The wedding took 
place at Shirley on June 18, 1793.  Although consenting to the marriage, Charles did ensure 
that Lee could not touch any of <span class="name" tag_id="0.86853200 1108115602">Ann</span>'s inheritance.  A near 
contemporaneous account of this courtship and its aftermath is provided in a linked  
<a href="http://members.aol.com/rphs44/1821ltr.html">1821 letter</a>.

<p>By the time of the birth of Robert, her fifth child [Algernon Sydney, the eldest did not 
survive],  Henry Lee was in deep financial trouble.  He was being pursued by his creditors and 
Stratford Hall, where the Lee's had gone to live, was being denuded of property and servants to 
satisfy their demands.  <span class="name" tag_id="0.86880300 1108115602">Ann</span> was sick with a cold and saddened by the death of her father when 
Robert Edward Lee, named for two of her brothers, was born on January 19, 1807.

In 1809, her husband was twice imprisoned for debt.  Circumstances reduced <span class="name" tag_id="0.86895600 1108115602">Ann</span> to delivering 
food in person to Lee's prison for lack of servants and teaching her children herself in 
Stratford's  Great Hall,  where they could find both heat and light from the fireplace. About 
this time <span class="name" tag_id="0.86911800 1108115602">Ann</span> was offered asylum for herself and her children by the husband of her late sister, 
Mildred.  <span class="name" tag_id="0.86922200 1108115602">Ann</span> refused to abandon her husband, choosing to maintain her home and family despite 
Henry's imprisonment.   Upon his release she did insist on the right to choose their residence.    
<span class="name" tag_id="0.86936200 1108115602">Ann</span> chose to move to Alexandria, VA, eventually renting William Henry Fitzhugh's home at 607 
Oronoco Street.  In this location, she had numerous family members nearby and her children were 
thus assured an education at their neighboring plantations and later the Alexandria Academy.

<p>In 1813 Henry's career and life in America came to an end when he went into virtual exile in 
the West Indies after being nearly killed and permanently injured in a political riot in 
Baltimore, MD.  Left on her own, <span class="name" tag_id="0.86961800 1108115602">Ann</span> husbanded her inheritance to provide for her children 
writing infrequently to Henry, who had even in good times seldom been much at home.  

<p>Of her children, Carter, the eldest, was closest to his father and was the addressee of most 
of his letters, though oft unmailed,  from exile.  Carter was also favored by <span class="name" tag_id="0.86981000 1108115602">Ann</span>'s brother 
William, who paid for his education at Harvard.  The younger sons were not so fortunate. Smith, 
the second son,  chose to go to sea, joining the US Navy.  Ann Kinloch, the eldest daughter and 
second eldest child spent much of her time away from home seeking medical attention for a 
condition, probably tuberculosis of the bone, which eventuated in the loss of her arm.  This 
left to Robert, the eldest remaining child, the principle responsibility for assisting <span class="name" tag_id="0.87019900 1108115602">Ann</span> 
during most of the Lee's stay in Alexandria.   In his mother's words he became "both son and 
daughter" to her.  There can be no doubt of a close personal attachment between mother and son.  
However, Nagel* concludes <span class="name" tag_id="0.87035700 1108115602">Ann</span> had no favorites.

<p>Upon Robert's departure for West Point, <span class="name" tag_id="0.87045200 1108115602">Ann</span> moved with her two daughters from Alexandria to 
Carter's home in Georgetown,  DC.where he practiced law.  Finally, her health deteriorating,  
she moved to the home of William Henry Fitzhugh's widow at Ravensworth in Fairfax County, VA.  
There she died on <span class="date_death" tag_id="0.97391200 1108116154">June 29. 1829</span>, but not before seeing Robert return after graduation from West 
Point, Carter and Smith with established careers in law and the Navy, daughter Ann Kinloch 
married  and daughter, Mildred, engaged. 

<p>Originally interred at Ravensworth, <span class="name" tag_id="0.87078600 1108115602">Ann</span>'s remains are now, along with those of her husband 
and son, in the Lee Crypt at Washington and Lee University, Lexington, VA.<p>

  tough to put your finger on an exact &quot;job title&quot;, but more, you <br>
  become a well rounded person. I always stress in situations, that the experience 
  <br>
  of working on projects with a completely diverse group of nationalities has 
  <br>
  been a gift. You learn how different cultures approach a certain solution <br>
  to a problem. Also, ECS &amp; P majors usually have personalities that are <br>
  creative and often outgoing. I was in a situation where I was working for the 
  <br>
  concierge service of American Express. I saw that a huge part of travel <br>
  done by clients was to Paris and the rest of France. I saw a niche needed for 
  <br>
  an expert in developing relationships with vendors and restaurants in France. 
  <br>
  I consulted with clients. That restaurant relationship experience later lead 
  <br>
  me to doing restaurant relations for Goldman Sachs in NYC. Fun!! That <br>
  company did some major layoffs, and we were all let go. I've recently <br>
  moved back to Los Angeles and am in the process of presenting some ideas for 
  <br>
  product development for a chocolate company. I saw something that was <br>
  missing and am hoping to create a position for myself.<br>
  The best advice is for students to get their first jobs out of school in <br>
  companies with big, powerful names. Get that experience and it tends to <br>
  open doors to other opportunities.<br>
  I'm happy to talk to students. For me, I was 34-35 years old when I was at <br>
  AUP. Perhaps it's a nice thing to appeal to the older student who is <br>
  either in the midst of a career change or just looking for new experience. I 
  was <br>
  lucky enough to have a few other students my age, whom to this day, we <br>
  remain best friends while in Miami, New York and Los Angeles.<br>
  Furthermore, EVERYONE in the USA is impressed with people who have been <br>
  educated outside of the USA. I've realized that the majority of people out <br>
  there have a fear of picking up and getting out of their comfort zone. So, <br>
  there are a ton of things to chat about.

<p>My laboratory studies immune control of chronic virus infections, concentrating on the cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response. We have two major interests; firstly, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as a tractable model of immunity to herpesviruses, and secondly, vaccine strategies to induce an effective CTL response to HIV. MCMV encodes several proteins which interfere with the MHC class I pathway of antigen presentation to CTL. We have identified a 34kD protein which binds to class I in the ER and travels with it to the cell surface. We are investigating the function of p34 using biochemical, cell biological, and cellular immunological approaches; using wild type MCMV and a virus specifically lacking p34. We are committed to establishing the MCMV model in sufficient detail to determine how the virus persists in the face of the immune response without causing disease. To this end, we have undertaken to identify the major CTL epitopes in MCMV. The HIV vaccine project uses mouse models to explore basic principles and the rhesus monkey-SIV model to test vaccine strategies. Our aim is to create high numbers of high avidity CTL in response to vectored SIV proteins, and to identify factors which correlate with reduction of virus load after challenge with virulent SIV. We have developed a herpes simplex (HSV) based vaccine which lacks ICP47, the HSV-encoded inhibitor of antigen processing, and which expresses SIV-gag. We postulate that a persistent virus may result in higher numbers of CTL over time. We are using a variety of other vectors in sequential immunizations to attempt to increase the relative immunodominance of the gag antigen in the heirarchy of vector CTL epitopes. </p>

        <P>My laboratory investigates T cell immunity to viral infections. Our 
          main interest is in herpesvirus immune evasion genes- how they function, 
          and what effect this has on the immune response to the virus and the 
          virus infective process. We use murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as our 
          main model.<br>
          <br>
          Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous infection, infecting approximately 
          70% of adults in the US. CMV infects in childhood and establishes lifelong 
          infection, usually without symptoms. Immunity to CMV occupies a surprisingly 
          high proportion of the immune system throughout life: around 4% of CD4+ 
          and 10% of CD8+ T cells in chronically infected people are specific 
          for CMV, probably more than for any other virus. This high number of 
          T cells is thought to be maintained by recurrent virus activity, which 
          nevertheless normally remains below the threshold of detection. However, 
          if immunity is compromised, CMV rapidly reactivates and is a main cause 
          of morbidity in most clinically immunocompromized states. It thus appears 
          that the chronic equilibrium between CMV and host involves a lot of 
          activity on both virus and host sides. The long term goal of my lab 
          is to understand this equilibrium and its consequences for the host.</P>
        <P>Like all herpesviruses, CMV encodes a series of genes that enable it 
          to avoid detection by cytotoxic T cells. We use the murine model of 
          CMV infection to understand how these genes impact the ability of the 
          immune system to control the virus. MCMV encodes three immune evasion 
          genes, m4, m6 and m152. m6 and m152 prevent MHC class I reaching the 
          cell surface, but m4 has a novel means of action. It interacts extensively 
          with class I in the ER, forming complexes that are detectable in digitonin 
          lysates of cells but are disrupted by NP40. A small amount of m4 forms 
          NP40-stable complexes with class I; these complexes travel to the surface 
          of the cell where they remain stably associated.<br>
          <br>
          The projects in my lab can be grouped into three broad areas:<br>
          (1)understanding the molecular mechanisms by which m4, m6 and m152 interfere 
          with antigen presentation <br>
          (2)understanding the normal immunobiology of MCMV infection<br>
          (3)understanding the impact of interference with antigen presentation 
          on the immunobiology of CMV infection.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>(1) understanding the molecular mechanisms by which m4, m6 and 
          m152 interfere with antigen presentation</strong><br>
          This project is currently mainly focused on understanding the mechanism 
          of action of m4. One of the main projects in my lab is to determine 
          at which site (the ER, the cell surface, or both) m4 is able to interfere 
          with antigen presentation. The effect of MCMV infection on the function 
          of the peptide loading complex in the ER, and on the function of the 
          immunological synapse at the cell surface, is being investigated.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>(2) understanding the normal immunobiology of MCMV infection</strong><br>
          A major effort has been put into identifying the immunodominant CTL 
          epitopes for B6 mice. To this end we have almost completed cloning the 
          MCMV genome into an expression vector, and are screening CTL clones 
          and splenocytes from infected mice. We will investigate the relative 
          immunodominance of the various epitopes over time. We also need a method 
          to monitor virus activity during chronic infection, and various approaches 
          are being explored. There is surprisingly little information about how 
          MCMV spreads from one host to another, and we are investigating this 
          to establish a reliable model of host to host spread. We are also interested 
          in the role of dendritic cells and direct infection versus cross-presentation 
          in driving the large CTL response, and the effect of the NK cell response 
          on CD8s. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>(3) understanding the impact of interference with antigen presentation 
          on the immunobiology of CMV infection.</strong><br>
          We have obtained from our collaborator Ulrich Koszinowski a series of 
          MCMV mutants lacking each of the immune evasion genes, alone and in 
          combination. We are investigating the size and specificity of the CTL 
          response to each of these viruses, and the ability of the virus to establish 
          latent infection. Surprisingly, avoiding antigen presentation does not 
          seem to be necessary for the ability of the virus to establish latent 
          infection, raising the question as to what the real function of these 
          genes is. This is being further explored, looking at their effect on 
          transmission to new hosts, and possible prevention of immunopathology.

<p class="content"><span class="name" tag_id="0.96876100 1108057775">Ann Hill</span> founded Creative Lifestyles, an organization serving developmentally disabled youth in the South Bronx. Seeing that the population was served primarily through agencies based outside of the Bronx, Hill went into New York City public schools to document the need for community-based services. She spoke at school gatherings and ultimately recruited up to 500 parents and their children, documenting their needs; she took the documentation to Albany. Today, Creative Lifestyles has two day programs and two to three state of the residential facilities. She was ahead of her time. </i><br /><br /></p>

<I>Special thanks to Yahoo!Geocities completely random crashing that has forced me to retype this page from memory months after creating it originally! Thank you, thank you, Geocities!</I><P><BR>
<h3>
<img src="annprofile.jpg"  align="left">When I started this website, I swore that it would not be a forum for bitching and complaining about the way certain events transpire. Therefore, I will not mention our less-than-successful shoot at Pittsburgh Filmmakers, nor the fellow filmmakers who usurped the room we had reserved two weeks in advance in order to film pick-up shots of the fight scene between Sister Bliss and Adam. I may not be the nicest guy in the world, but back in the day when I was a student, if I discovered that, having taken over one of the unused classrooms on a weekend, that another member had needed it, and all I was using it for was to have potential actors fill out forms, and knowing that there were plenty of other rooms available, I would have said, Oh, yeah, no problem man. Theres only three people in here. Ill move them out. I would not have said, But we reserved this room last week, and I came in early to arrange all the chairs in nice rows. And I dont want to move these people out of there because actors need to concentrate and besides I reserved this room two weeks ago! I might even have said, If you hang on a few minutes, lets give these guys time to finish what theyre doing. You wanna get one of the other rooms open for me, Id appreciate it. Sorry about the mix-up. I certainly would not have said, Hey, man, this rooms, like, crucial to our audition space. What, you want me to make these guys wait outside? Sorry.<P>
So, I wont talk about any of that. Except to say that independent filmmakers  even students  are all in the same boat. We may get cranky, and we may not feel that each project is on the same worthiness level as another, but theres no excuse for being rude and irascible, particularly when asked politely for something, and particularly when youre trying to share facilities. Also remember that every filmmaker is using a crew that consists of people who know other people. If you piss off one member of the crew, you are bound to piss off a dozen more, and soon your name has spread like a virus throughout the virtual crew bloodstream and woe unto you should you ever need a favor from someone  anyone  connected in any way with that crew. So, as a word of advice, be polite and professional to each other at all times. Thank you. And yes, we did get those pick-up shots, in another room, where the lay-out doesnt match, but if we keep the editing tight, chances are it will work. If it doesnt, Ill know who to thank. <P><BR><BR>
Enough vitriol. Lets move on to the next day, Sunday. Sunday was much better.<P>
The opening sequence of the film is one of the few scenes to remain consistent during all drafts of the script. We knew from the beginning that we would be blasted by hard-core horror fans for seemingly ripping off George Romeros classic Living Dead trilogy -- which, in many cases, we are, and well be up front about this  -- so it was always our intention to be blatant right off the bat, in order to say, Here, well save you the trouble; <I>this</I> is what we are doing! The sequence involves The Executive interrogating a woman who claims to have been attacked by a zombie in a graveyard. (The only change we made to the scene was moving it from an ordinary interrogation room to <span class="name" tag_id="0.81505800 1108133063">Ann Hill</span>s house itself, which we feel serves the scene better  the idea of Godcorp invading someones home  and out of convenience, which Ill explain in a minute). You get to see, via black and white flashbacks, <span class="name" tag_id="0.20567400 1108133146">Ann</span>s attack and subsequent escape from this Cemetery Zombie. This was going to be our tribute to the original <I>Night of the Living Dead</I> and we wanted to be as blatant as possible.<P>
Originally, our plan was to approach Bill Hinzman, the original Cemetery Zombie. Its been thirty-odd years since Bill made his debut as the classic ghoul, and though he doesnt much look like his 1967 self (no, his reprisal of the role in <I>NOTLD: The 30th Anniversary Edition</I> doesnt count!), we thought it would be a nice twist. However, when the time came to shoot the scene, Mr. Hinzman was unavailable. <P>
<img src="sewingdan.jpg" align="left">No matter. We found our perfect cemetery zombie in the form of longtime friend and sometime-co-conspirator, Dan Franklin. Dans the lead singer of the Pittsburgh rockabilly band <a href="http://members.nbci.com/bastardland/">The Filthy Bastards</a> (and this isnt the first time weve had a bastard in our film. Lead guitarist Mike Athey appears as a guard in <a href="http://www.geocities.com/happycloudprod/climax.html">The Climax</a>, and drummer Casey Larocca is a zombie in <a href="http://www.geocities.com/happycloudprod/roxanne.html">The Antonia Trowbridge Sequence</a>). Dan is naturally emaciated, pale and sickly, with the dead, hollow stare of a zombie to begin with. In fact, in order to make him appear dead, makeup artist Bill Homan would most likely have to make Dan look healthier and then work from there. (Sorry, Dan, those are the best insults I could come up with!) Once we got him into a tight suit, Dan looked so much like the Hinzman of years gone by, the results were frightening.<P><BR>

Our <span class="name" tag_id="0.81588800 1108133063">Ann Hill</span> was found in <span class="name" tag_id="0.43541900 1108133126">Gina Precciado</span>, who also performs in the improv comedy troupe, <a href="http://users.sgi.net/~gemini1/geminihome.htm">The Amish Monkeys</a> with executive producer and lead villain Francis Veltri. <span class="name" tag_id="0.88006300 1108133168">Gina</span> is a versatile actress and comedienne, and was absolutely perfect as the angry and frustrated <span class="name" tag_id="0.20680000 1108133146">Ann</span>.<P>
To cap off the day, good friend Bill Hahner happens to be an expert on <I>Night of the Living Dead</I>, and was able to recreate some of the key shots from that films cemetery sequence. Bill was also generous enough to lend us his home, which was right across the street from a beautiful cemetery (which is why we rewrote the scene to be set in <span class="name" tag_id="0.20700100 1108133146">Ann</span>s home, rather than try to shoot the scene on two different days in separate locations. See how things work out?)<P><img src="danNgina.jpg" align="right">
We shot all the outdoor stuff on black and white reversal film, and the results are striking and beautiful. The choice of filmstock actually backfired on us at first. We had ordered B&W negative, but the supply house sent us reversal instead. Rather than send it back  which would have been out of the question, as the house dragged its feet on shipping  we opted to use what we had and try to adjust, as reversal has much lower latitude and margin of error than negative. Once shot, we then discovered that our local lab, WRS, Inc., no longer processes b&w reversal, so we were forced to find another lab that would. Ultimately, we found <a href="http://www.cinelab.com/">Cinelab</a> in Boston, which did a fine job with a great turnaround time. <P>
The shoot in the cemetery itself was great fun. Bill Hahner just glanced around, found locations that would well-match the cemetery of the original and we went to work. (Again, we actually scouted locations at the Evans City cemetery, where the original <I>NOTLD</I> crew shot, but discovered that over the years, the cemetery had changed and no longer looks the way it does in that long-ago film.) It wasnt a busy day, so there werent many gawking on-lookers. The true fun came when Dan had to attack <span class="name" tag_id="0.88109800 1108133168">Gina</span>. We threw <span class="name" tag_id="0.88117300 1108133168">Gina</span> on the ground, then threw a perfect stranger on top of her. She couldnt wait to tell her husband! <P>
My one regret was not getting a great gag on film. The closer we get to the end of this two-year-plus ordeal, the sillier weve been getting. During one sequence, Dan had to chase <span class="name" tag_id="0.88134900 1108133168">Gina</span> through the maze of headstones, and after two or three shots of this, we joked that we should have gotten a shot of her chasing him. It would have been a hilarious outtake, but, alas, we ran out of time.<P>
All in all, it turned out to be a great, productive weekend, with Sunday being a welcome contrast to Saturdays fiasco. <P><BR>

<br />
As Juamei said, not the most evocative Hill Fort in Britain, but a pleasant walk if you can try to forget the constant hum of the traffic from the nearby (but unseen) M ways.  The whole of the open area covers 57 acres in all.<br />
<br />
The info board gives a tiny bit of info on the hill "<span class="name" tag_id="0.05109600 1108052723">St.Ann's Hill</span> takes its name form a chapel built around 1334 dedicated to St.Ann. Its original name was <span class="name" tag_id="0.59755200 1108052631">Eldebury (Oldbury) Hill</span> with an old fort, and there are traces of old earthen defences on the top.  The most notable resident of the Hill was the radical politician Charles Fox whose house was opposite the present main entrance.  The hill was presented to the Local Authority by Baron Camrose of Longcross and opened by the Rt.Hon. Neville Chamberlain MP in June 1928".<br />
<br />
The ramparts are not particularly strongly preserved. Best on the west side.  Also strong on the East side but the track up to the Reservoir Cottage (at the top of the hill) makes them look a bit false.<br />
<br />
NB &#8211; The roads towards the hill are signposted to a point but overgrown at the crucial turnoff onto '<span class="name" tag_id="0.79238500 1108052683">St.Anns Hill</span> Rd' so look for the road sign of that name.            </td>

[visited 30/3/3] Another tree clad hillfort imperceptable as such unless you look closely. There is a sort of bank-ditch combo kinda encircling the hill, but not cared for and in one place replaced by huge girt concrete steps. The ever present distant roar of the M25 / M3 / Heathrow really detracts from this otherwise pleasant little retreat from North Surrey.<br />
<br />
The best viewpoint in the place affords a nice view of a couple of rivers / lakes in the foreground and Heathrow just past them. We can only imagine what it was like even 100 years ago compared to now, I'm guessing somewhat more relaxing...<br />
<br />
So in all, very nice I'm sure for the residents of Chertsey, somewhat less appealing for those of us who entered this area just for this experience. Go to <a href="http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/3502">Oldbury</a> instead, you'll be glad you did!         </td>

        <P>My laboratory investigates T cell immunity to viral infections. Our 
          main interest is in herpesvirus immune evasion genes- how they function, 
          and what effect this has on the immune response to the virus and the 
          virus infective process. We use murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as our 
          main model.<br>
          <br>
          Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous infection, infecting approximately 
          70% of adults in the US. CMV infects in childhood and establishes lifelong 
          infection, usually without symptoms. Immunity to CMV occupies a surprisingly 
          high proportion of the immune system throughout life: around 4% of CD4+ 
          and 10% of CD8+ T cells in chronically infected people are specific 
          for CMV, probably more than for any other virus. This high number of 
          T cells is thought to be maintained by recurrent virus activity, which 
          nevertheless normally remains below the threshold of detection. However, 
          if immunity is compromised, CMV rapidly reactivates and is a main cause 
          of morbidity in most clinically immunocompromized states. It thus appears 
          that the chronic equilibrium between CMV and host involves a lot of 
          activity on both virus and host sides. The long term goal of my lab 
          is to understand this equilibrium and its consequences for the host.</P>
        <P>Like all herpesviruses, CMV encodes a series of genes that enable it 
          to avoid detection by cytotoxic T cells. We use the murine model of 
          CMV infection to understand how these genes impact the ability of the 
          immune system to control the virus. MCMV encodes three immune evasion 
          genes, m4, m6 and m152. m6 and m152 prevent MHC class I reaching the 
          cell surface, but m4 has a novel means of action. It interacts extensively 
          with class I in the ER, forming complexes that are detectable in digitonin 
          lysates of cells but are disrupted by NP40. A small amount of m4 forms 
          NP40-stable complexes with class I; these complexes travel to the surface 
          of the cell where they remain stably associated.<br>
          <br>
          The projects in my lab can be grouped into three broad areas:<br>
          (1)understanding the molecular mechanisms by which m4, m6 and m152 interfere 
          with antigen presentation <br>
          (2)understanding the normal immunobiology of MCMV infection<br>
          (3)understanding the impact of interference with antigen presentation 
          on the immunobiology of CMV infection.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>(1) understanding the molecular mechanisms by which m4, m6 and 
          m152 interfere with antigen presentation</strong><br>
          This project is currently mainly focused on understanding the mechanism 
          of action of m4. One of the main projects in my lab is to determine 
          at which site (the ER, the cell surface, or both) m4 is able to interfere 
          with antigen presentation. The effect of MCMV infection on the function 
          of the peptide loading complex in the ER, and on the function of the 
          immunological synapse at the cell surface, is being investigated.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>(2) understanding the normal immunobiology of MCMV infection</strong><br>
          A major effort has been put into identifying the immunodominant CTL 
          epitopes for B6 mice. To this end we have almost completed cloning the 
          MCMV genome into an expression vector, and are screening CTL clones 
          and splenocytes from infected mice. We will investigate the relative 
          immunodominance of the various epitopes over time. We also need a method 
          to monitor virus activity during chronic infection, and various approaches 
          are being explored. There is surprisingly little information about how 
          MCMV spreads from one host to another, and we are investigating this 
          to establish a reliable model of host to host spread. We are also interested 
          in the role of dendritic cells and direct infection versus cross-presentation 
          in driving the large CTL response, and the effect of the NK cell response 
          on CD8s. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>(3) understanding the impact of interference with antigen presentation 
          on the immunobiology of CMV infection.</strong><br>
          We have obtained from our collaborator Ulrich Koszinowski a series of 
          MCMV mutants lacking each of the immune evasion genes, alone and in 
          combination. We are investigating the size and specificity of the CTL 
          response to each of these viruses, and the ability of the virus to establish 
          latent infection. Surprisingly, avoiding antigen presentation does not 
          seem to be necessary for the ability of the virus to establish latent 
          infection, raising the question as to what the real function of these 
          genes is. This is being further explored, looking at their effect on 
          transmission to new hosts, and possible prevention of immunopathology.

                Added 07/05/2004 - Don't let the schoolgirl look fool you - this woman is bad news. Meet <span class="name" tag_id="0.04193500 1108050572">Jessica Ann Hill</span>, seen here in a mug taken by the Morgan County (Alabama) Sheriff's Department after they arrested her, and her boyfriend, Timothy House, on charges they allegedly broke into a disabled man's home, robbed him, then shot him in the head.  Their victim suffered from arthritis and could barely get around, so apparently they thought he was an easy mark.  <span class="name" tag_id="0.94357200 1108050605">Hill</span> was also arrested in December of 2003 for another violent assault and robbery of a Decatur man - so this is beginning to look like a pattern.  Lock her up and throw away the key.  Maybe she can get those giant cow lips fixed while she's in the Big House.

<P>
<B>I</B> have ten years of experience in group dream work, and have recently begun teaching this method to others. I bring to my dreamwork practice almost 20 years of public service as a <span class="job" tag_id="0.81350900 1108056894">priestess</span> in contemporary Pagan spiritual traditions, and many years experience as a group facilitator. In 1998 I co-authored, with Starhawk, the book Circle Round: Raising Children in Goddess Traditions. My essays, poetry, polemics and music have been published in various anthologies and periodicals over the years, and I am currently at work on a book about <span class="job" tag_id="0.81373300 1108056894">priestess</span>ing. I lead a monthly dream group at Harbin Hot Springs in Middletown, CA, offer dreamwork classes periodically in Sonoma County, and travel a modest amount holding workshops and talking to people about various aspects of dreamwork and spirituality. I am <span class="definition" tag_id="0.36592200 1108056913">an avid student of aikido</span>, have a Pagan music distribution business, and spend a lot of time with my wonderful teenagers, husband, and dog.
</P>

<P>
 <B>J</B>oined ASD: I joined ASD at the suggestion of Jeremy and Kathy Taylor, whose good advice I usually follow. I'm quite enjoying this network of people engaged with dreaming life.
</P>

<P>
 <B>F</B>avorite Dream: I don't know if this qualifies as my favorite dream *ever*, but it is certainly one of my favorites. It occurred just as I was drifting off to sleep one night. I am walking down Mission St. in San Francisco, heading toward Cafe Commons. Except it's called Gnosis Cafe, and there's a tilted sign with a teacup on it out front. Then I become lucid and realize I'm starting to dream, and that the Gnosis Cafe is where I go to dream.

Sources:John W. McClure served during the Civil War in Co. F, 99th 
Regiment
Infantry, Indiana Volunteers; they participated in many battles, as 
well as
Sherman's March to the Sea.  Pension records give his date of birth, 
marriage
date, date of death.  His wife, Melvina Harper, applied for a widow's 

pension
following his death.  Her application contains her date of birth and 
marriage
date.  A copy of their marriage license from Montgomery Co, IL on 
26th July
1871, confirms the date.  Burial dates and place of interment are 
also verified
by obituaries and death certificates.  Horsecreek Cemetery has been 
counted by
local genealogists and verified their place of burial.

Flavius Valerius Constantius (called Chiorus - "the Pale") was b. ca. 250
<BR>
per Encyclopaedia Britannica ('56; 6:313), and "was of Illyrian origin.
<BR>
Having distinguished himself by his military ability and his able and
<BR>
gentle rule of Dalmatia, he was, on March 1, 293, adopted and appointed
<BR>
Caesar by Maximian.  In the distribution of the provinces Gaul and Britain
<BR>
were allotted to Constantius.  ...During the persecution of the Christians
<BR>
in 303 he behaved with great humanity.  He obtained the title of Augustus
<BR>
on May 1, 305, and died the following year before July 25 at Eboracum
<BR>
(York) during an expedition against the Picts and Scots." The somewhat
<BR>
fanciful ancestry shown in this database is from John Duran, 4/92, and is
<BR>
not verified (this ancestry continues back to Philip of Macedonia and his
<BR>
son, Lagos "The Rabbit").

Your clue is "holly nearest seat, 190m south of beacon".<img src="gcanpub.jpg" width=200 height=150 align=right> <span class="name" tag_id="0.34687100 1108052520">Saint Ann's Hill</span> takes its name from a chapel built around 1334 dedicated to St. Ann. It's original name was <span class="name" tag_id="0.55362100 1108052534">Eldebury (Oldbury) Hill</span> with an old fort, and there are traces of old earthen defences on the top. You may have passed this thickly forested hill, not far from the M3/M25 motorway junction, and overlooking Thorpe Amusement Park - and not given it a second glance.<br><br><br>This location is certainly not in the same league as <A HREF="http://www.gpss.co.uk/geocache/gchc.htm">Hampton Court</A> or <A HREF="http://www.gpss.co.uk/geocache/gcwc.htm">Windsor Castle</A>, but it is still worth a visit. The nearest pub is "The Golden Grove" at N 51° 23.581 W 000° 31.136 walking distance from the road named <span class="name" tag_id="0.04737400 1108052553">St. Anne's Hill</span>, signed to the nature trail park. Free car parking is in the lane at N 51° 23.810 W 000° 31.400 <img src="gcandell.jpg" width=200 height=150 align=left> Go through the iron gates and follow the nature trail signs. The path wind around the top of the hill, passing a flat grass area called "The Dell" which has several picnic tables and an impressive upturned tree root. <img src="gcanbeac.jpg" width=200 height=150 align=right> Further round the hill you will find lookout points - bring your binoculars :-) The best is probably that where there is a beacon, and you can see both Thorpe Park, in the foreground, and Heathrow Airport beyond. Sorry to disappoint you, but the beacon is not so ancient, having been erected in the early 1980's - to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the sighting of The Great Armada as it approached from Spain in 1588. You should have no problem finding the Geocache, which is a moderate sized tupperware box, holding disposable camera for you to take a picture then return to the cache, toys and lots of other low cost "goodies".<br><br><center><img src="gcanpath.jpg"></center><br><br>

<!--body: begin-->
I would love to speculate about my recent find!<br>
<br>
My grandmother's grandfather was Bennet (Augustine) Higdon, (b. 1842
Grayson Co., d. 1916 Edmonson Co., KY) who married in KY 1868 Margaret
Ellen Sims (b. 1845 Hardin Co., d. 1905 Hart Co. KY- inscription on her
gravestone: wife of Bennet).<br>
<br>
He is named as the only surviving son of <span class="name" tag_id="0.91012600 1108131199">Elizabeth Ann (Hill) Higdon</span>
(b.abt <span class="date_birth" tag_id="0.70125300 1108131214">1817</span> <span class="place_birth" tag_id="0.36921500 1108131224">Maryland</span>) at the time of her death (in <span class="date_death" tag_id="0.83691500 1108131240">1866</span>) and again in
1877 in the record of her Widow's Pension for the Civil War service of
John Thomas Higdon (b. abt 1818 Maryland, d. 1862 Athens, AL in war).
He is the only Bennet Higdon in 1870 Grayson Co. Census and he is a
perfect fit for age, etc.<br>
<br>
The pension application contains a record of their marriage of 1839, in
Grayson Co. This relationship is confirmed by naming Bennet as their
son in the Grayson County, Ky Census of 1860 and 1850 (where a brother
Ignatious is also listed). There is also a Thomas listed on the Grayson
Co. census of 1840 that would fit this family scenerio.<br>
<br>
The 1850 census for JT &amp; family has adjoining entries for a Samuel
Higdon 41 bp. Maryland with wife Joannah and 6 children, and then Milly
E. 59 with son Nace 18.<br>
<br>
My speculation is that this John Thomas is the son of Ignatious and Mildred E. Dyson.<br>
Also open to debate:<br>
Perhaps Samuel and 'Nace' (Ignatious)were JT's brothers?<br>
Any ideas about Bennet, who served in KY 3rd- could this be my gggrandpappy also?<br>
Any help on this line would be appreciated!<br>
Diane<br>

This book focuses on the crucial questions higher education leaders are asking about these "learning marketspace" partnerships: What do they look like? How will they influence educational delivery systems? When should an institution initiate such a partnership effort? What type of leader is needed for learning marketspace partnerships? What makes such partnerships successful? <p> <i><span class="work" tag_id="0.02550700 1108118165">Partnering in the Learning Marketspace</span></i> describes how leaders in higher education, government, community, and business can form productive partnerships to leverage the best content and provide a gateway to that content for learners around the globe. The authors present a framework for understanding the learning marketspace concept and offer an engaging blueprint for developing and implementing partnerships to support lifelong learners. The book includes practical information that will help potential learning marketspace partners learn to: understand the dynamics of marketspace portals; set priorities for partnering; assess partnership readiness; overcome obstacles to building partnerships; develop tools to support learners in e-mentor and e-community relationships; and identify leadership competencies in a global learning marketspace. <p> The book includes insightful commentaries by national and international education leaders who have participated in electronic learning environments.</div>

Transcriber's Notes:
 
In the column "Country to which they belong", England is written 
   for only the 1st passenger.  There are no ditto or other marks 
   to indicate the rest of the passengers were from England.
In the column "Country to which they intend to become inhabitants", 
   Texas is written for only the 1st passenger.  There are no ditto 
   or other marks to indicate the rest of the passengers intended to 
   inhabit Texas.

  1   Histable:  The 1st letter of the surname is written slightly differently 
                 than other examples of the letter H in this manifest.
 36   Page:      could be Paye
 42   Senfield:  could be Serrfield
108   Milton:    could be Mildon
119   Benton:    could be Benten or Bintin.
134   Makiey:    Surname written over, looks like it started out to be written 
                 Mackey.

*  Last digit in age could be 0, not 9

No births or deaths were reported.
The captain's name is not reported on the manifest.
The ship's name is written Issabella, not Isabella, on this manifest.

<B>Correspondence 6/12/2000</B>
I've recently found your transcription of the passenger list for the 
Issabella.  May I say a huge thank you - it is, I believe, the first 
transcritpion of any ship's passenger list for a sailing from Torquay 
in South Devon.  Immigration sailings were apparently quite common 
from here throughout the 1800's, the most common ships being Crossmans 
Timber boats - "Margaret" and "Sarah Fleming" which advertised to take 
passengers from Torquay to Canada for the princely sum of 3 pounds 10 
sterling and then the ships returned loaded with timber.

Unfortunately our local newspaper archive only goes back to 1852, so I 
was not able to trace the sailing you transcribed, but I did find a 
mention in the "Torquay Directory" of 21st April 1852 of the ship 
Isabella having returned to Torquay harbour after having undergone 
repairs in Teignmouth.  (Teignmouth is about 8 miles up the coast)

<A NAME="Trant">
<B>Correspondence 4/17/01 passengers #16-24 Trant</B>
I am related to the Trants listed on the Issabella's manifest.  They 
settled in Grimes County, Texas, on land which is still in the family.  I 
believe that the house which we call our family homeplace was purchased with 
the land.  It has been restored to resemble the original (two room house with 
a breezeway {dogtrot} running between the rooms) and has a historical marker. 
There is an old family cemetary close to the house and there is a list 
available naming most of the persons buried there.  Samuel and John (the 
youngest) fought for the Confederate army during the Civil War with John 
being killed in Virginia. Supposedly, my grandfather was born on the ship 
coming to Galveston.  He had sixteen children and my father, Samuel Amon 
Trant, was the youngest.  I am Samuel Stephen Trant the youngest of his 
children.  I was always told that my great grandfather brought indentured 
servants with him from England.  I don't know much about my family while they 
were in England, but I do know that they came from County Kerry in Ireland.  
Anyone doing research on this family please contact <A HREF="mailto:samtrant@tcainternet.com">Sam Trant</A>
<A NAME="Taylor">
<B>Correspondence 5/22/01 passengers #9-15 Taylor</B> [another correspondece below]
I am related to the Taylors listed on the Issabella's manifest.  They
settled in Grimes County, Texas outside of Iola, Texas on a bend in the
Navasota River referred to a "Taylor Island".  William Taylor, Sr continued
to work as a stone mason in the northern Grimes County area.  After his
first wife, Elizabeth Townsend, died he re-married twice.  He is buried at a
family cemetery adjacent to "Taylor Island" along with several other
relatives. <A HREF="mailto:STaylor@bellhelicopter.textron.com">Taylor, Scott</A>

<B>Correspondence 01/13/2004 passengers #9-15 Taylor</B>
My ancestor was listed on the Bark Isabella, his name is William Taylor, 
b. 1808 Devonshire, Eng. Settled in Grimes Co, Texas, Taylor Island.

<B>Correspondence 6/21/02 passengers #3 Histable, #38 Bluckler, #104 Lidstone </B>
While checking the passengers on the Barke Issabella against the 1850 
Texas census I found a few differences.

  3. George Histable is listed as Huxtable
 38. Wm Bluckler is listed as Blackler
104. Nickloas Lidstone is listed as Litstrom

The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. (http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0833011.html): "Michael (Michael Romanov), 15961645, czar of Russia (161345), founder of the Romanov dynasty; grandnephew of Anastasia, first wife of Ivan IV. His election as czar, following successive appearances of false pretenders, ended the so-called Time of Troubles, a period of social and political chaos in Russia that had begun in the late 16th cent. The real power in the government was Michael's father, the patriarch Philaret (d. 1633). During Michael's reign the peasantry was further reduced to serfdom; peace was temporarily obtained with Poland and Sweden; and some Western industrial and military techniques were introduced by foreign manufacturers and other experts. Michael was succeeded by his son Alexis."

<title>The Shattered Chalice by Kathryn Ann Hill</title>
</head>


<body>



<p align="center"><img border="0" src="logo.jpg"></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Impact" size="5" color="#CC0033"><span class="work" tag_id="0.94499900 1108129563">The Shattered Chalice:&nbsp; Arthur and Christ in Howard Pyle</span></font><font face="Verdana"><br>
By <span class="name" tag_id="0.34856000 1108129553">Kathryn Ann Hill</span></font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">It is not required that Christians be readers: faith comes by hearing. But
it is often true that believers in Christ, born and reared by words of the utmost importance and beauty, will develop a love for literature that wants
feeding. So, when you are not reading the Good Book, where do you turn for a good read?</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Turn to Howard Pyle's Arthuriad. The tales of King Arthur and his knights
"were never so finely told in prose before," wrote Mark Twain of his fellow American's four-book series. These are stories of knights and the famous
round table, of queens and romance, of chivalry and courage. But even beyond the plots and characters, the themes in the
stories can point us toward Christ.</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Lutheran readers accustomed to the liturgy and hymns of The Lutheran Hymnal
will feel right at home with Pyle's stately prose. Consider this excerpt from the first book:</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Then Merlin smiled upon the King, though not with cheerfulness, and said,
"Lord, why art thou in such haste? Know that when this Round Table shall be entirely filled in all its seats, then shall thy glory be entirely achieved
and then forthwith shall thy day begin for to decline. For when any man hath reached the crowning of his glory, then his work is done and God breaketh
him as a man might break a chalice from which such perfect ichor hath been drunk that no baser wine may be allowed to defile it. So when thy work is
done and ended shall God shatter the chalice of thy life."</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Then did the King look very steadfastly into Merlin's face, and said, "Old
man, that which thou sayest is ever of great wonder, for thou speakest words of wisdom. Ne'theless, seeing that I am in God His
hands, I do wish for my glory and for His good will to be accomplished even though He shall then
entirely break me when I have served His purposes."</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Lutherans find here not only familiar elegant diction, but also an arresting
word picture that helps us meditate on the Passion of our Lord. The Gospel of John teaches us that Christ is glorified when He is lifted up on the
cross (John 3:14-15; 8:28; 12:23-24, 32; 17:1-4). His crowning glory there is a crown of thorns. The blood Christ shed there is the perfect sacrifice
for sin, acceptable to the heavenly Father as the perfect wine is offered to and accepted by the lord of a banquet. Christ drank the cup of God's wrath
(Mark 14:36; John 18:11). It pleased God to crush Him (Isaiah 53:10). By faith in our Savior, we are spared the death our sins deserve. We receive
instead, from His Holy Chalice, forgiving, life-giving blood.</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Pyle's Arthuriad, like other books about Arthur published in the early
twentieth century, was meant to teach young men chivalry and integrity. No Christian would quarrel with Pyle's exhortations, placed here and there
between compelling knightly adventures, to imitate good behavior and avoid temptation. But Lutheran readers will find most thrilling those glimpses of
Christ that show forth in knightly deeds.</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Our Lord suffered humiliation in order to work our redemption. Think of
Christ when you read more of this episode from book three: In order to free the captive Queen Guinevere after his horse is slain, noble Launcelot rides
to the rescue in a fagotmaker's cart. This was the mode of transport reserved for lawbreakers on their way to the gallows. Though he accomplishes
the queen's rescue, he is bitterly scorned by his kinsmen knights for choosing this humble way of travel.</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">In loyalty to his king, Sir Gawaine weds an ugly old hag to reward her for
saving Arthur's life. Read this story with a surprise ending in book one. Then ponder how Gawaine's marriage is a picture of Christ and His Church.
Pyle's Arthuriad is by no means the exclusive territory of young men. Young women will also find sympathetic, exemplary heroines. There is likely
nowhere else in English fiction a more powerful picture of womanly dignity and grace than Elaine the Fair's behavior when she finds her husband alone
with the powerful, seductive Guinevere.</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Fans of the popular Harry Potter books and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings will
find similar attractions within the world of King Arthur. When the luminous Lady of the Lake appears, Rings fans will be sure
they have wandered very near Tolkien's Elvish forest. The wizard Merlin, guardian and advisor to
Arthur, is likely the model for Gandalf. And Morgana le Fay and the more-than-mischievous Vivien, out of envy and spite, work potent spells
against good King Arthur.</font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Even better than discovering a good book is to find that its author has
written several sequels. Pyle's four books of Arthurian tales promise you many hours of reading pleasure, with moments that will
quicken your understanding of Christ's redeeming work for you.</font></p>

Higher Ed leaders, this one is well worth your time, April 2, 2001
 


 
 Reviewer:

Rhonda Epper

from Denver, CO USA

As someone who is working to forge new partnerships in the learning marketspace, I learned a lot from this book. The authors helped me understand some of the key elements to look for in evaluating whether a partnership is worthwhile: bottom line is &quot;an organization should partner as a means to empower learners and enhance its mission.&quot; In reaching this bottom line, the book helps you set priorities for partnering and assess your readiness to do so. Best of all, it's a pleasure to read. I finished it in about two hours - time well spent!
