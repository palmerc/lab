DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       llaattttiiccee--ttooooll performs operations on word lattices in ppffssgg--
       ffoorrmmaatt(5) or in HTK Standard Lattice format (SLF).  Opera-
       tions  include size reduction, pruning, null-node removal,
       weight assignment from language models, lattice word error
       computation, and decoding of the best hypotheses.

       Each  input  lattice is processed in turn, and a series of
       optional operations  is  performed  in  a  fixed  sequence
       (regardless  of  the  order in which corresponding options
       are specified).  The sequence of operations is as follows:

       1.     Read input lattice.

       2.     Score  pronunciations (if dictionary was supplied).

       3.     Split multiword word nodes.

       4.     Posterior- and density-based pruning (before reduc-
              tion).

       5.     Write word posterior lattice.

       6.     Perform word-posterior based decoding.

       7.     Write word mesh (confusion network).

       8.     Compute  word  and  transition posteriors (forward-
              backward algorithm), and N-gram  counts  if  speci-
              fied.

       9.     Compute lattice density.

       10.    Check lattice connectivity.

       11.    Compute node entropy.

       12.    Compute lattice word error.

       13.    Output reference word posteriors.

       14.    Remove null nodes.

       15.    Lattice reduction.

       16.    Posterior-  and density-based pruning (after reduc-
              tion).

       17.    Remove pause nodes.

       18.    Lattice reduction (post-pause removal).

       19.    Language model replacement or expansion  (see  note
              in BBUUGGSS section).

       20.    Pause recovery or insertion.

       21.    Lattice reduction (post-LM expansion).

       22.    Multiword splitting (post-LM expansion).

       23.    Merging of same-word nodes.

       24.    Lattice algebra operations (or, concatenation).

       25.    Viterbi-decode  best  hypothesis and/or generate N-
              best lists.

       26.    Lattice-LM perplexity computation.

       27.    Writing output lattice.

       The following options control which of these  steps  actu-
       ally apply.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Each  filename  argument  can  be an ASCII file, or a com-
       pressed file (name ending in .Z or .gz), or ``-'' to indi-
       cate stdin/stdout.

       --hheellpp  Print option summary.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information.

       --ddeebbuugg _l_e_v_e_l
              Set  the  debugging output level (0 means no debug-
              ging  output).   Debugging  messages  are  sent  to
              stderr.

       --iinn--llaattttiiccee _f_i_l_e
              Read input lattice from _f_i_l_e.

       --iinn--llaattttiiccee22 _f_i_l_e
              Read  additional  input lattice (for binary lattice
              operations) from _f_i_l_e.

       --iinn--llaattttiiccee--lliisstt _f_i_l_e
              Read list of input  lattices  from  _f_i_l_e.   Lattice
              operations  are  applied to each filename listed in
              _f_i_l_e.

       --oouutt--llaattttiiccee _f_i_l_e
              Write result lattice to _f_i_l_e.

       --oouutt--llaattttiiccee--ddiirr _d_i_r
              Write result lattices from processing  of  --iinn--llaatt--
              ttiiccee--lliisstt to directory _d_i_r.

       --rreeaadd--mmeesshh
              Assume  input  lattices are in word mesh (confusion
              network) format, as described in wwllaatt--ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       --wwrriittee--iinntteerrnnaall
              Write output lattices with internal node  numbering
              instead of compact, consecutive numbering.

       --oovveerrwwrriittee
              Overwrite existing output lattice files.

       --vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Initialize  the vocabulary to words listed in _f_i_l_e.
              This is useful in conjunction with

       --lliimmiitt--vvooccaabb
              Discard LM parameters on reading that do  not  per-
              tain to the words specified in the vocabulary.  The
              default is that words used in the LM are  automati-
              cally  added to the vocabulary.  This option can be
              used to reduce the memory  requirements  for  large
              LMs;  to  this  end, --vvooccaabb typically specifies the
              set of words used in the lattices to  be  processed
              (which  has  to  be generated beforehand, see ppffssgg--
              ssccrriippttss(1)).

       --vvooccaabb--aalliiaasseess _f_i_l_e
              Reads vocabulary alias definitions from _f_i_l_e,  con-
              sisting of lines of the form
                   _a_l_i_a_s _w_o_r_d
              This  causes all tokens _a_l_i_a_s to be mapped to _w_o_r_d.

       --uunnkk   Map lattice words not contained in the known vocab-
              ulary with the unknown word tag.  This is useful if
              the rescoring LM contains  a  probability  for  the
              unknown word (i.e., is an open-vocabulary LM).  The
              known vocabulary is given by what is  specified  by
              the  --vvooccaabb  option, as well as all words in the LM
              used for rescoring.

       --mmaapp--uunnkk _w_o_r_d
              Map out-of-vocabulary words to  _w_o_r_d,  rather  than
              the default <<uunnkk>> tag.

       --ttoolloowweerr
              Map all vocabulary to lowercase.

       --nnoonneevveennttss _f_i_l_e
              Read  a  list of words from _f_i_l_e that are used only
              as context elements, and are not predicted  by  the
              LM,  similar  to  ``<s>''.   If --kkeeeepp--ppaauussee is also
              specified then pauses are not treated as  nonevents
              by default.

       --mmaaxx--ttiimmee _T
              Limit processing time per lattice to _T seconds.

       Options controlling lattice operations:

       --wwrriittee--ppoosstteerriioorrss _f_i_l_e
              Compute the posteriors of lattice nodes and transi-
              tions (using the  forward-backward  algorithm)  and
              write  out  a  word  posterior lattice in wwllaatt--ffoorr--
              mmaatt(5).  This and other options based on  posterior
              probabilities  make most sense if the input lattice
              contains combined acoustic-language model  weights.

       --wwrriittee--ppoosstteerriioorrss--ddiirr _d_i_r
              Similar  to  the  above, but posterior lattices are
              written to separate files in directory  _d_i_r,  named
              after the utterance IDs.

       --wwrriittee--mmeesshh _f_i_l_e
              Construct a word confusion network ("sausage") from
              the lattice and write it  to  _f_i_l_e.   If  reference
              words are available for the utterance (specified by
              --rreeff--ffiillee or --rreeff--lliisstt)  their  alignment  will  be
              recorded in the sausage.

       --wwrriittee--mmeesshh--ddiirr _d_i_r
              Similar,  but  write sausages to files in _d_i_r named
              after the utterance IDs.

       --iinniitt--mmeesshh _f_i_l_e
              Initialize the word confusion network by reading an
              existing   sausage  from  _f_i_l_e.   This  effectively
              aligns the lattice being processed to the  existing
              sausage.

       --aaccoouussttiicc--mmeesshh
              Preserve  word-level  acoustic  information (times,
              scores, and pronunciations) in sausages, encoded as
              described in wwllaatt--ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--pprruunnee _P
              Prune  lattice  nodes  with  posteriors less than _P
              times the highest posterior path.

       --ddeennssiittyy--pprruunnee _D
              Prune lattices such that the lattice density  (non-
              null words per second) does not exceed _D.

       --nnooddeess--pprruunnee _N
              Prune  lattices  such that the total number of non-
              null, non-pause nodes does not exceed _N.

       --ffaasstt--pprruunnee
              Choose a faster pruning  algorithm  that  does  not
              recompute posteriors after each iteration.

       --wwrriittee--nnggrraammss _f_i_l_e
              Compute  posterior  expected  N-gram counts in lat-
              tices and output them to _f_i_l_e.  The maximal  N-gram
              length  is  given by the --oorrddeerr option (see below).
              The counts from all lattices processed are  accumu-
              lated and output at the end.

       --wwrriittee--nnggrraamm--iinnddeexx _f_i_l_e
              Output  an  index  file of all N-gram occurences in
              the  lattices  processed,  including  their   start
              times, durations, and posterior probabilities.  The
              maximal N-gram length is given by the --oorrddeerr option
              (see below).

       --mmiinn--ccoouunntt _C
              Prune  N-grams  with  count less than _C from output
              with --wwrriittee--nnggrraammss and --wwrriittee--nnggrraamm--iinnddeexx.  In  the
              former case, the threshold applies to the aggregate
              occurrence counts; in the latter case, the  thresh-
              old  applies  to  the  posterior  probability of an
              individual occurence.

       --mmaaxx--nnggrraamm--ppaauussee _T
              Index only N-grams  that  contain  internal  pauses
              (between  words)  not exceeding _T seconds (assuming
              time stamps are recorded in the input lattice).

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--ssccaallee _S
              Scale the transition weights by dividing by  _S  for
              the  purpose  of posterior probability computation.
              If the input weights represent  combined  acoustic-
              language  model scores then this should be approxi-
              mately the language model weight of the  recognizer
              in  order  to  avoid  overly peaked posteriors (the
              default value is 8).

       --wwrriittee--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Output the list of all  words  found  in  the  lat-
              tice(s) to _f_i_l_e.

       --rreedduuccee
              Reduce  lattice size by a single forward node merg-
              ing pass.

       --rreedduuccee--iitteerraattee _I
              Reduce lattice size by  up  to  _I  forward-backward
              node merging passes.

       --oovveerrllaapp--rraattiioo _R
              Perform  approximate  lattice  reduction by merging
              nodes that share more than a fraction  _R  of  their
              incoming  or  outgoing  nodes.   The  default is 0,
              i.e., only exact lattice reduction is performed.

       --oovveerrllaapp--bbaassee _B
              If _B is 0 (the default), then the overlap  ratio  _R
              is taken relative to the smaller set of transitions
              being compared.  If the value is 1,  the  ratio  is
              relative to the larger of the two sets.

       --rreedduuccee--bbeeffoorree--pprruunniinngg
              Perform  lattice  reduction  before posterior-based
              pruning.  The default order is to first prune, then
              reduce.

       --pprree--rreedduuccee--iitteerraattee _I
              Perform iterative reduction prior to lattice expan-
              sion, but after pause elimination.

       --ppoosstt--rreedduuccee--iitteerraattee _I
              Perform iterative reduction after lattice expansion
              and  pause node recovery.  Note: this is not recom-
              mended as it changes the weights assigned from  the
              specified language model.

       --nnoo--nnuullllss
              Eliminate NULL nodes from lattices.

       --nnoo--ppaauussee
              Eliminate  pause  nodes  from  lattices (and do not
              recover them after lattice expansion).

       --ccoommppaacctt--ppaauussee
              Use compact encoding  of  pause  nodes  that  saves
              nodes  but  allows optional pauses where they might
              not have been included in the original lattice.

       --lloooopp--ppaauussee
              Add self-loops on pause nodes.

       --iinnsseerrtt--ppaauussee
              Insert optional pauses after every word in the lat-
              tice.  The structure of inserted pauses is affected
              by --ccoommppaacctt--ppaauussee and --lloooopp--ppaauussee.

       --ccoollllaappssee--ssaammee--wwoorrddss
              Perform an operation on  the  final  lattices  that
              collapses  all  nodes  with  the same words, except
              null nodes, pause nodes, or nodes with noise words.
              This  can reduce the lattice size dramatically, but
              also introduces new paths.

       --ccoonnnneeccttiivviittyy
              Check the connectedness of lattices.

       --ccoommppuuttee--nnooddee--eennttrrooppyy
              Compute the node entropy of lattices.

       --ccoommppuuttee--ppoosstteerriioorrss
              Compute node  posterior  probabilities  (which  are
              included in HTK lattice output).

       --ddeennssiittyy
              Compute and output lattice densities.

       --rreeff--lliisstt _f_i_l_e
              Read  reference  word strings from _f_i_l_e.  Each line
              starts with a sentence ID (the basename of the lat-
              tice  file  name), followed by the words.  This and
              the next option  triggers  computation  of  lattice
              word  errors (minimum word error counts of any path
              through a lattice).

       --rreeff--ffiillee _f_i_l_e
              Read reference word strings from _f_i_l_e.  Lines  must
              contain  reference  words only, and must be matched
              to input lattices in the order processed.

       --wwrriittee--rreeffss _f_i_l_e
              Write the references back to _f_i_l_e (for validation).

       --aadddd--rreeffss _P
              Add  the  reference  words as an additional path to
              the lattice, with probability _P.  Unless  --nnoo--ppaauussee
              is  specified,  optional  pause nodes between words
              are also added.  Note that this operation  is  per-
              formed  before  lattice reduction and expansion, so
              the new path can be merged with existing ones,  and
              the  probabilities  for  the  new path can be reas-
              signed from an LM later.

       --nnooiissee--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read a list of ``noise'' words  from  _f_i_l_e.   These
              words  are  ignored  when  computing  lattice  word
              errors, when decoding the best word sequence  using
              --vviitteerrbbii--ddeeccooddee  or --ppoosstteerriioorr--ddeeccooddee, or when col-
              lapsing nodes with --ccoollllaappssee--ssaammee--wwoorrddss.

       --kkeeeepp--ppaauussee
              Causes the pause word ``-pau-'' to be treated  like
              a  regular  word.   It  prevents  pause  from being
              implicitly added to the list of noise words.

       --iiggnnoorree--vvooccaabb _f_i_l_e
              Read a list of words that are to be ignored in lat-
              tice  operations,  similar to pause tokens.  Unlike
              noise words (see above) they are also skipped  dur-
              ing  LM  evaluation.   With  this option and --kkeeeepp--
              ppaauussee, pause words are not ignored by default.

       --sspplliitt--mmuullttiiwwoorrddss
              Split lattice nodes with multiwords into a sequence
              of  non-multiword  nodes.  This option is necessary
              to compute  lattice  error  of  multiword  lattices
              against non-multiword references, but may be useful
              in its own right.

       --sspplliitt--mmuullttiiwwoorrddss--aafftteerr--llmm
              Perform multiword splitting after lattice expansion
              using the specified LM.  This should be used if the
              LM uses multiwords, but the final lattices are  not
              supposed to contain multiwords.

       --mmuullttiiwwoorrdd--ddiiccttiioonnaarryy _f_i_l_e
              Read  a  dictionary  from _f_i_l_e containing multiword
              pronunciations and word boundary markers  (a  ``|''
              phone  label).  Specifying such a dictionary allows
              the multiword splitting options to  infer  accurate
              time  marks  and  pronunciation information for the
              multiword components.

       --mmuullttii--cchhaarr _C
              Designate _C as the character  used  for  separating
              multiword components.  The default is an underscore
              ``_''.

       --ooppeerraattiioonn _O
              Perform a lattice algebra operation _O on  the  lat-
              tice or lattices processed, with the second operand
              specified by  --iinn--llaattttiiccee22.   Operations  currently
              supported  are  ccoonnccaatteennaattee  and oorr, for serial and
              parallel lattice combination, respectively, and are
              applied after all other lattices manipulations.

       --vviitteerrbbii--ddeeccooddee
              Print  out  the  word sequence corresponding to the
              highest probability path.

       --ppoosstteerriioorr--ddeeccooddee
              Print out the word sequence  with  lowest  expected
              word error.

       --oouuttppuutt--ccttmm
              Output  word  sequences  in  NIST CTM (conversation
              time mark) format.  Note that word start times will
              be  relative  to  the lattice start time, the first
              column will contain the lattice name, and the chan-
              nel  field  is always 1.  The word confidence field
              contains  posterior  probabilities  if  --ppoosstteerriioorr--
              ddeeccooddee  is  in  effect.   This  option also implies
              --aaccoouussttiicc--mmeesshh.

       --hhiiddddeenn--vvooccaabb file
              Read a subvocabulary from _f_i_l_e and  constrain  word
              meshes  to  only  align those words that are either
              all in or outside the subvocabulary.  This  may  be
              used  to  keep  ``hidden event'' tags from aligning
              with regular words.

       --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy--aalliiggnn
              Use the dictionary  pronunciations  specified  with
              --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy  to  induce a word distance metric used
              for word mesh alignment.  See the  nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee(1)
              --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy option.

       --nnbbeesstt--ddeeccooddee _N
              Generate  the up to _N highest scoring paths through
              a lattice and write them  out  in  nnbbeesstt--ffoorrmmaatt(5),
              along with optional additional score files to store
              knowledge sources encoded in the lattice.   Further
              options  are  needed  to specify the location of N-
              best lists and score files, described  below  under
              "N-BEST   DECODING".   Duplicated  Hypotheses  that
              differ only  in  pause  and  words  specified  with
              --iiggnnoorree--vvooccaabb  are  removed from the N-best output.
              If the --mmuullttiiwwoorrddss option is specified,  duplicates
              due to multiwords are also eliminated.

       --nnbbeesstt--dduupplliiccaatteess _K
              Allow  up to _K duplicate word hypotheses to be out-
              put in N-best decoding.

       --nnbbeesstt--mmaaxx--ssttaacckk _M
              Limits the depth of the hypothesis stack used in N-
              best decoding to _M entries, which may be useful for
              limiting memory use and runtime.

       --nnbbeesstt--vviitteerrbbii
              Use a Viterbi algorithm to generate N-best,  rather
              than  A-star.   This  uses less memory but may take
              more time.

       --ppppll _f_i_l_e
              Read sentences from _f_i_l_e and  compute  the  maximum
              probability  (of  any path) assigned to them by the
              lattice being processed.  Effectively, the  lattice
              is  treated  as  a (deficient) language model.  The
              output detail is controlled by the  --ddeebbuugg  option,
              similar  to  nnggrraamm  --ppppll  output.   (In particular,
              --ddeebbuugg 22 enables tracing of  lattice  nodes  corre-
              sponding  to  sentence  prefixes.)  Pause words in
              _f_i_l_e are treated as regular words and have to match
              pause  nodes in the lattice, unless --nnooppaauussee speci-
              fied, in which case  pauses  in  both  lattice  and
              input sentences are ignored.

       The  following  options  control transition weight assign-
       ment:

       --oorrddeerr _n
              Set the maximal N-gram order to be used for transi-
              tion weight assignment (the default is 3).

       --llmm _f_i_l_e
              Read  N-gram language model from _f_i_l_e.  This option
              also  triggers  weight  reassignment  and   lattice
              expansion.

       --mmuullttiiwwoorrddss
              Resolve multiwords in the lattice without splitting
              nodes.  This is useful in rescoring  lattices  con-
              taining  multiwords  with  a LM does not use multi-
              words.

       --ccllaasssseess _f_i_l_e
              Interpret the LM as an N-gram  over  word  classes.
              The  expansions of the classes are given in _f_i_l_e in
              ccllaasssseess--ffoorrmmaatt(5).  Tokens in the LM that  are  not
              defined  as classes in _f_i_l_e are assumed to be plain
              words, so that the LM  can  contain  mixed  N-grams
              over both words and word classes.

       --ssiimmppllee--ccllaasssseess
              Assume  a "simple" class model: each word is member
              of at most one word class, and class expansions are
              exactly one word long.

       --mmiixx--llmm _f_i_l_e
              Read   a  second  N-gram  model  for  interpolation
              purposes.  The second and any  additional  interpo-
              lated  models  can also be class N-grams (using the
              same --ccllaasssseess definitions).

       --ffaaccttoorreedd
              Interpret the files specified by --llmm, --mmiixx--llmm, etc.
              as   factored  N-gram  model  specifications.   See
              nnggrraamm(1) for more details.

       --llaammbbddaa _w_e_i_g_h_t
              Set the weight of the main model when interpolating
              with --mmiixx--llmm.  Default value is 0.5.

       --mmiixx--llmm22 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm33 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm44 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm55 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm66 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm77 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm88 _f_i_l_e

       --mmiixx--llmm99 _f_i_l_e
              Up  to  9  more  N-gram models can be specified for
              interpolation.

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa22 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa33 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa44 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa55 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa66 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa77 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa88 _w_e_i_g_h_t

       --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa99 _w_e_i_g_h_t
              These are the weights for  the  additional  mixture
              components, corresponding to --mmiixx--llmm22 through --mmiixx--
              llmm99.  The weight for the --mmiixx--llmm model is  1  minus
              the  sum  of --llaammbbddaa and --mmiixx--llaammbbddaa22 through --mmiixx--
              llaammbbddaa99.

       --bbaayyeess _l_e_n_g_t_h
              Set the context length used for Bayesian interpola-
              tion.   The default value is 0, giving the standard
              fixed interpolation weight specified by --llaammbbddaa.

       --bbaayyeess--ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e
              Set the exponential scale  factor  on  the  context
              likelihood in conjunction with the --bbaayyeess function.
              Default value is 1.0.

       --ccoommppaacctt--eexxppaannssiioonn
              Use a compact expansion algorithm that uses backoff
              nodes  to reduce the size of expanded lattices (see
              paper reference below).

       --oolldd--eexxppaannssiioonn
              Use older versions of the lattice  expansion  algo-
              rithms (both regular and compact), that handle only
              trigram models and require elimination of null  and
              pause  nodes  prior to expansion.  Not recommended,
              but  useful  if  full  backward  compatibility   is
              required.

       --mmaaxx--nnooddeess _M
              Abort  lattices  expansion when the number of nodes
              (including null and pause nodes) exceeds  _M.   This
              is  another  mechanism  to  avoid spending too much
              time on very large lattices.

LLAATTTTIICCEE EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN AALLGGOORRIITTHHMMSS
       llaattttiiccee--ttooooll incorporates several different algorithms  to
       apply  LM weights to lattices.  This section explains what
       algorithms are applied given what options.

       CCoommppaacctt LLMM eexxppaannssiioonn
              This expands the nodes and transitions to  be  able
              to  assign  higher-order  probabilities  to transi-
              tions.  Backoffs in the LM  are  exploited  in  the
              expansion,  thereby  minimizing the number of added
              nodes (Weng et al., 1998).  This algorithm is trig-
              gered  by --ccoommppaacctt--eexxppaannssiioonn For the resulting lat-
              tices to work correctly, backoff paths  in  the  LM
              must  have  lower  weight  than  the  corresponding
              higher-order paths.  (For N-gram LMs, this  can  be
              achieved  using  the nnggrraamm --pprruunnee--lloowwpprroobbss option.)
              Pauses and null nodes are handled during the expan-
              sion and do not have to be removed and restored.

       GGeenneerraall LLMM eexxppaannssiioonn
              This  expands the lattice to apply LMs of arbitrary
              order, without use of  backoff  transitions.   This
              algorithm is the default (no --ccoommppaacctt--eexxppaannssiioonn).

       UUnniiggrraamm wweeiigghhtt rreeppllaacceemmeenntt
              This simply replaces the weights on lattice transi-
              tions with unigram log probabilities.  No modifica-
              tion  of  the  lattice structure is required.  This
              algorithm is used if --oolldd--eexxppaannssiioonn  and  --oorrddeerr  11
              are specified.

       BBiiggrraamm wweeiigghhtt rreeppllaacceemmeenntt
              This  replaces  the  transition weights with bigram
              log probabilities.  Pause and null nodes have to be
              eliminated prior to the operation, and are restored
              after weight replacement.  This algorithm  is  used

       llaattttiiccee--ttooooll can optionally read, process, and output lat-
       tices in  HTK  Standard  Lattice  Format.   The  following
       options control HTK lattice processing.

       --rreeaadd--hhttkk
              Read  input  lattices  in HTK format.  All lattices
              are internally represented  as  PFSGs;  to  achieve
              this  HTK  lattices  links are mapped to PFSG nodes
              (with attached word and score information), and HTK
              lattice nodes are mapped to PFSG NULL nodes.  Tran-
              sitions are created so as  to  preserve  words  and
              scores  of  all paths through the original lattice.
              On output, this mapping is reversed, so as to  cre-
              ate  a  compact  encoding  of PFSGs containing NULL
              nodes as HTK lattices.

              ...

       --hhttkk--xx99ssccaallee _S

       --hhttkk--wwddppeennaallttyy _S
              These options specify the weights for acoustic, LM,
              N-gram,  pronunciation,  and duration models, up to
              nine extra  scores,  as  well  as  word  transition
              penalties  to  be  used  for  combining the various
              scores contained in  HTK  lattices.   The  combined
              scores  are  then  used  to  compute the transition
              weights  for  the  internal  PFSG   representation.
              Default  weights  are  obtained from the specifica-
              tions in the lattice files themselves.
              Word transition penalties are scaled  according  to
              the log base used.  Values specified on the command
              line are scaled according to --hhttkk--llooggbbaassee,  or  the
              default 10.  Word transition penalties specified in
              the lattice file are scaled according  to  the  log
              base specified in the file, or the default _e.

       --hhttkk--llooggzzeerroo _Z
              Replace  HTK  lattices  score  that are zero (minus
              infinity on the log scale) by the log-base-10 score
              _Z.   This  is typically used after rescoring with a
              language model that  assigns  probability  zero  to
              some  words  in  the lattice, and allows meaningful
              computation of posterior probabilities  and  1-best
              hypotheses from such lattices.

       --nnoo--hhttkk--nnuullllss
              Eliminate  NULL nodes otherwise created by the con-
              version of HTK lattices  to  PFSGs.   This  creates
              additional  links  and  may  or  may not reduce the
              overall processing time required.

       --ddiiccttiioonnaarryy _f_i_l_e
              Read a dictionary containing  pronunciation  proba-
              bilities  from _f_i_l_e, and add or replace the pronun-
              ciation scores in the  lattice  accordingly.   This
              requires  that the lattices contain phone alignment
              information.

       --iinnttllooggss
              Assume the dictionary  contains  log  probabilities
              encoded  on  the  int-log scale, as used by the SRI
              Decipher system.

       --wwrriittee--hhttkk
              Write output lattices in HTK format.  If the  input
              lattices  were  in  PFSG  format  the original PFSG
              weights will be  output  as  HTK  acoustic  scores.
              However,  LM  rescoring  will  discard the original
              PFSG weights and the results will be encoded as  LM
              scores.   Pronunciation  scoring  results  will  be
              encoded as pronunciations scores.  If the --ccoommppuuttee--
              ppoosstteerriioorrss  was used in lattice processing the out-
              put lattices will also contain node posterior prob-
              abilities.   If the input lattices were in HTK for-
              mat, then acoustic and  duration  scores  are  pre-
              served  from the input lattices.  The score scaling
              factors in the  lattice  header  will  reflect  the
              --hhttkk--**ssccaallee options given above.

       --hhttkk--llooggbbaassee _B
              Modify  the  logarithm base in HTK lattices output.
              The default is to use logs base 10, as elsewhere in
              SRILM.  As value of 0 means to output probabilities
              instead of log probabilities.  Note  that  the  log
              base  for  input  lattices  is not affected by this
              option; it is encoded in the  lattices  themselves,
              and  defaults to _e according to the HTK SLF defini-
              tion.

       --hhttkk--wwoorrddss--oonn--nnooddeess
              Output word labels and other word-related  informa-
              tion  on HTK lattice nodes, rather than links, thus
              saving space.  This option  is  provided  only  for
              compatibility  with  software  that  requires  word
              information to be attached specifically to links of
              nodes.

       --hhttkk--ssccoorreess--oonn--nnooddeess
              Output  scores  on  HTK  lattice nodes, rather than
              links.

       Note:  The options --nnoo--hhttkk--nnuullllss, --hhttkk--wwoorrddss--oonn--nnooddeess, and
              --hhttkk--ssccoorreess--oonn--nnooddeess defeat the mapping of internal
              PFSG nodes back  to  HTK  transitions,  and  should
              therefore  NOT be used when a compact output repre-
              sentation is desired.

       --hhttkk--qquuootteess
              Enable the HTK string quoting mechanism that allows
              whitespace and other non-printable characters to be
              included in words labels and other fields.  This is
              disabled  by  default since PFSG lattices and other
              SRILM tools don't support  such  word  labels.   It
              affects  both  input and output format for HTK lat-
              tices.

NN--BBEESSTT DDEECCOODDIINNGG
       The option --nnbbeesstt--ddeeccooddee  triggers  generation  of  N-best
       lists,  according  to the aggregate score of paths encoded
       in the lattice.  The output format for  N-best  lists  and
       associated additional score files is compatible with other
       SRILM tools that  process  N-best  lists,  such  as  those
       described  in  nnbbeesstt--llaattttiiccee(1) and nnbbeesstt--ssccrriippttss(1).  The
       following options control the location of output files:

       --oouutt--nnbbeesstt--ddiirr _d_i_r
              The directory to which N-best list files are  writ-
              ten.  These contain acoustic model scores, language
              model scores, word counts, and the word  hypotheses
              themselves,  in SRILM format as described in nnbbeesstt--
              ffoorrmmaatt(5).

       --oouutt--nnbbeesstt--ddiirr--nnggrraamm _d_i_r
              Output directory for separate N-gram LM  scores  as
              may be encoded in HTK lattices.

       --oouutt--nnbbeesstt--ddiirr--pprroonn _d_i_r
              Output  directory  for pronunciation scores encoded
              in HTK lattices.

       --oouutt--nnbbeesstt--ddiirr--dduurr _d_i_r
              Output directory for duration model scores  encoded
              in HTK lattices.

       --oouutt--nnbbeesstt--ddiirr--xxssccoorree11 _d_i_r

              Output  score directories for up to nine additional
              knowledge sources encoded in HTK lattices.

       --oouutt--nnbbeesstt--ddiirr--rrttttmm _d_i_r
              N-best hypotheses in NIST RTTM format.  This  func-
              tion  is  experimental  and makes assumptions about
              the input file naming conventions to  infer  timing
              information.

       LM  rescoring  and  expansion replaces the combined scores
       computed from an HTK-style lattice with the new LM scores.
       One-best or N-best decoding operations in the same invoca-
       tion will therefore no longer have access to the  combined
       scores.   To  extract hypotheses according to updated com-
       bined scores it is necessary to  write  out  the  rescored
       lattices  and  decode  them  in a second invocation of the
       tool.

       Not all LM types supported by nnggrraamm(1) are handled by llaatt--
       ttiiccee--ttooooll..

       Care must be taken when processing multiword lattices with
       --uunnkk and --mmuullttiiwwoorrddss or --sspplliitt--mmuullttiiwwoorrddss.  Multiwords not
       listed  in  the  LM (or the explicit vocabulary specified)
       will be considered ``unknown'', even though  their  compo-
       nents might be in-vocabulary.

       The  --nnbbeesstt--dduupplliiccaatteess  option does not work together with
       --nnbbeesstt--vviitteerrbbii.

       Input lattice in HTK format may contain node or link  pos-
       terior  information.   However, this information is effec-
       tively discarded; posteriors are  always  recomputed  from
       scores when needed for pruning or output.

       The  --nnoo--nnuullllss,  --nnoo--ppaauussee and --ccoommppaacctt--ppaauussee options dis-
       card the acoustic information  associated  with  NULL  and
       pause nodes in HTK lattice input, and should therefore not
       be used if equivalent HTK lattice output is intended.
